      <h1>Binge Eating Has A Surprising Root</h1>
      <p>"Just one last time".</p>

      <p>
        Have you said this to yourself a few hundred times over the years? You
        envision life as it could be without binges, eating normally, no secrecy
        or shame, finally being in control of your eating and your body. But
        then there's that urgent desire, to do it *one more time*.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pull to repeat and reinforce a harmful pattern of eating points to
        the biggest misunderstanding about binge eating. It is not all bad. It
        is serving a function for you. This "good part" about binge eating is
        different for each person. When we fully clarify the reasons you
        personally rely on binge eating, we have the roadmap to getting it out
        of your life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's discover what binge eating is doing for you. Then, let's outsource
        those roles to other sources, by getting you the comfort, calm, release,
        or fun you need. Let's render your binge eating so obsolete so you don't
        want to do it "one last time", because you have better things to do.
      </p>
      <h2>We have three ways to help you "Break Up With Binge Eating"</h2>
      <p>
        First, joining our twice-yearly group coaching program. We're running one now.  <a href="breaking-up.html">Check it out here.</a>

      <p>
        Second, work with one of our handpicked, Georgie-trained coaches. You
        won't find a more capable and caring bunch of coaches anywhere.
