    >You know how on game shows, there may be 3 people vying for an awesome
    grand prize, such as a car or $10,000 round the world trip? But the people
    who come in second and third place often don&rsquo;t just get shown the
    door. They get a </span

    >I think the term &ldquo;consolation prize&rdquo; is cute and funny. It
    consoles you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you didn&rsquo;t get what you wanted,
    but here have this instead!&rdquo;&nbsp;</span

    >It&rsquo;s actually a very kind move of the game shows, I think, to
    acknowledge the disappointment of a contestant who got all excited but then
    let down (in front of millions of people, to boot). It shows generosity and
    compassion.&nbsp;</span

    That&rsquo;s a step up from denying our true feelings like, &ldquo;nah, I
    shouldn&rsquo;t be bothered by this.&rdquo; It also could be helpful in
    fostering our cognitive flexibility - our ability to switch thinking from
    one thing to another. Rather than be stuck in a blue mood for days or weeks,
    hung up on the one &ldquo;dream house&rdquo; we wanted to buy - that someone
    else snatched -&nbsp; we&rsquo;d cope more easily. We could acknowledge,
    &ldquo;yep, that&rsquo;s a bummer, but I do have sweet concert tickets for
    this weekend, and I&rsquo;ll resume house hunting next week.&rdquo; I think
    it's healthy to do something to help cheer yourself up when you can't have
    exactly what you want, when you want it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span

      >I see consolation prize mentality cause&nbsp;people trouble, however,
      when the consolation prize they are giving themselves is always
      food.</strong

    Usually it&rsquo;s subconscious, not something we recognize. People
    don&rsquo;t think or say out loud, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have a nap, and
    I&rsquo;m so dang tired, so I&rsquo;ll have a cupcake!&rdquo; &ldquo;I just
    want some peace and quiet and alone time - but all four kids are home during
    the day right now. So I&rsquo;ll find a bag of chips.&rdquo; Food is so
    convenient, and it's everywhere. Using food as a consolation prize can be
    come a several-times-a-day thing.&nbsp;</span

    >It&rsquo;s not obvious like that when we&rsquo;re doing it. Day to day
    living often doesn&rsquo;t involve tuning in and specifying what we are
    needing and wanting, we just have periods of being disgruntled or
    &ldquo;wanty&rdquo;. And grabbing something to eat is often a habitual,
    convenient and private thing we can do that seems to have a shot of
    improving the situation. No one (other than a nutrition coach) would stop
    you to ask "Why you were eating if you weren't hungry? Was there something
    else you wanted?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Nope. People don't really notice if we eat all the time.&nbsp;<br /></span

    Like sleep, quiet time, or a break from being responsible. And it stinks,
    but that&rsquo;s reality, that we sometimes don&rsquo;t get what we really
    want or need, at least in the moment. Hence, if you notice your troublesome
    eating times are when you are tired, overwhelmed by people, or have been
    running nonstop errands, this might be part of the pattern. You
    haven&rsquo;t been getting what you want, and you still can&rsquo;t have it
    now, so you find a consolation prize (and eat it).

  If you recognize yourself doing this, giving yourself food consolation prizes,
  pat yourself on the back for having the awareness.
  <strong
    >Then,&nbsp;before you grab your next edible consolation prize, look for
    something different.</strong
  >
  Maybe a few minutes outside to sit in the sun would be nice. Maybe a Tylenol
  would help your headache, or an upbeat song on your headphones would help
  bring you around a bit. Or promising yourself a nap as soon as you get home.
  It okay to feel disappointed, frustrated, or tired still, but other things in
  life can still be enjoyed even while you have those emotions.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong
    >The scariest part of this pattern is that when we frequently eat to fulfil
    our needs for things other than food, when the thing we really need
    actually&nbsp;becomes available, we still might turn to food out of
    habit.</strong
  >
  We can get to the break in our workday, or the quiet hour after the kids are
  in bed, or the time when we finally have someone to listen to us... and sadly,
  reach for&nbsp;food instead of taking the rest, enjoying the quiet, or sharing
  our thoughts with a friendly ear.&nbsp;

      >The best possible outcome of catching yourself about to eat a consolation
      prize, is when you realize that you CAN still have the thing you want -
      and taking the opportunity to get it.</strong
    >&nbsp; You definitely don&rsquo;t need to settle for a consolation prize
    out of habit if the&nbsp;first&nbsp;prize, the things you need
    most,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline">is</span> right there
    for the taking.&nbsp;</span
