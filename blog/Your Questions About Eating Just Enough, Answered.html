<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Yes, there is a continuum of emptiness to fullness - no brick wall or
    signpost which obviously smacks you in the head and clues you in. STOP HERE!
    However, rather than think of the thing you are noticing as a straight line
    (how full am I? or how much have I eaten?), try to think of it as a bell
    curve (how good do I physically feel?). Clearly, this is NOT a straight
    line, where the more we eat the better we feel. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong
    >Important: It&rsquo;s key to focus on physical feelings here, not your

  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >I can&rsquo;t tell you how many bites that is, and if you try to count, it
    will be different tomorrow. But you have been doing this thing (eating) for
    years. You have a good idea of how it goes! You feel better and better and
    better, then it feels kind of the same for a while, then you start to feel
    worse and worse. </span
  ><strong
    >When it stops getting better, that&rsquo;s satisfied. That&rsquo;s enough.
    There&rsquo;s nothing more to gain after you feel as good, physically, as
    food is going to get you.&nbsp; </strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >There are some bites which don&rsquo;t do anything in terms of feeling
    better or worse (coming back to those in a moment), and after that, each
    bite is making you feel worse.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img

</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >So if you consider stopping before satisfied, you&rsquo;d feel better if
    you ate more. And I encourage you to do that. (It&rsquo;s great! If you
    haven&rsquo;t done in a long time, you&rsquo;re welcome!)</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >And if you consider the downslope, stopping when you are feeling worse and
    worse with each bite, I suggest limiting your own discomfort as early as
    possible once you realize you are doing it. (In life, in general, noticing
    when we are creating our own suffering&nbsp; -- and stopping -- is a

    after that which won&rsquo;t make you feel worse, but if you want to lose
    weight, consider that they are not making your body feel any better, they
    are less enjoyable than previous bites, and they contain the same calories
    as all the bites you had before. You are getting a worse and worse deal as
    you go. Diminishing marginal returns in action.&nbsp;</span

<h1>2. How The Timing Shakes Out&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >I&rsquo;ve written extensively about the human appetite systems and how
    meals can be designed to offer the greatest satiety per calorie. </span
  ><strong
    >In a nutshell, 30% or more calories from protein, ample volume from fresh
    fruits and vegetables to create a low overall calorie density, close to 30%
    calories from fat, preference for solid foods over liquid and complex
    carbohydrates high in fiber over processed ones, and in doses at least 400
    calories at a time. If that nutshell leaves you wanting more detail, pick up
    Lean Habits.&nbsp;</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  Assuming you are making your meals that way, Eating Just Enough typically
  lasts people 4-6 hours. Can it be more or less, yes, but the vast majority of
  the time, 4-6 hours is a trustworthy rule of thumb.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >If you are feeling hungry after only 2 or 3 hours, you likely 1. did a
    mammoth training session (2 or 3 hours running or other cardio? Sure, you
    can be hungry again that fast) or 2. Had a meal that was too low in fat, too
    low in protein, was liquid instead of solid, or you stopped before Just
    Enough, which happens when we are scared of overdoing it out of an
    overabundance of caution. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Other stuff which can interfere: If you drink too much water along with
    your meal, it will lower the calorie density of the whole meal so you might
    hit Just Enough without taking in adequate food. That can make you feel
    hungry soon. The easiest way around this is to stop drinking once you start
    eating, and let the food be the thing that gets you to Just Enough.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >If you get more than 6 hours before you feel hungry again, that&rsquo;s
    100% fine. More time to go play outside. If you WANT to get hungry sooner
    for scheduling purposes, try reducing the amount of fat in your meal
    slightly, since this has the biggest impact on the longevity of the
    satiety.&nbsp;</span

<h1>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">The Speed of the Signals </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span>
</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >That sense of physically feeling better and becoming satisfied as we eat is
    the collaborative effect of several different pathways (again, read
    <a
      href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Habits-Lifelong-Weight-Loss/dp/1624141129"
      >Lean Habits</a
    >
    for the full discussion, as I&rsquo;ll just summarize two of them here.) And
    they operate on different time courses. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >The fastest one we have is a stretch receptor pathway, which is a direct
    nerve connection between the stomach walls, up the vagus nerve to the brain
    and as close to a &ldquo;volume sensor&rdquo; as we have. Drink a big bottle
    of club soda and boom - you feel that belly bloat. It doesn&rsquo;t give you
    an &ldquo;aaaaaah, satisfied&rdquo; feeling on it&rsquo;s own, it&rsquo;s
    mostly just feeling full. If it is followed up by the other nutrient-sensing
    pathways, then you will feel actually satisfied, and an alleviation of
    hunger. But if you just downed some bubbly water, false alarm, your hunger
    will return. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >That &ldquo;hotline&rdquo; or fast signal is followed by pathways
    communicating to you brain information about the nutrients in whatever is
    putting pressure on your stomach walls. Understandably, it takes some time
    for your digestive tracts to start dismantling what you&rsquo;ve eaten and
    figuring out things like &ldquo;Are there amino acids in here? How
    much?&nbsp; Do we sense some fats? How about carbohydrates, and how much
    total energy have we gotten at this point? This is all going on while you
    are eating, giving a stream of information to the chairman in your skull
    (the brain) who determines how satisfied you feel. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Fats are the slowest things to register in this scheme. It takes time to
    begin breaking down the triglyceride molecules, which then trigger chemical
    messengers called hormones to be released into circulation and make their
    way to the brain. Fat also slows down the other signals, because it delays
    the pace of carbohydrates and proteins from leaving the stomach and entering
    the top of the small intestine, which is where carbohydrate and protein
    digestion gets going. The digestion and absorption of protein and
    carbohydrate molecules starts the initial &ldquo;accounting&rdquo; for other
    satisfaction hormones to be produced and send signals to the brain. So fat
    slows down everything. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >This is why if you eat meals very low in fat, you can absorb things more
    rapidly and easily, and be hungry again pretty soon. Low fat meals also tend
    to be low in calories. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >So if you eat a higher fat meal, it might take 30 or 40 minutes to notice
    you are full instead of 20. You can eat a lot of extra pizza or fettuccine
    in that extra 10 or 20 minutes, right? </span
  ><strong
    >This is why when you are focusing on EJE, it&rsquo;s a great idea to eat
    extra slowly when you are having something with a higher amount of
    fat.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    You&rsquo;ll get satisfied, but it&rsquo;s delayed, so if you plow through
    at your normal pace, you&rsquo;re likely to keep eating until you some
    satisfaction signals but then the delayed signals will catch up with and
    make you feel beyond full, into the uncomfortable downslope of our
    &ldquo;Feeling good&rdquo; hill. And you will have taken in enough calories
    to not be hungry for a long time. Which isn&rsquo;t a good or bad thing, I
    just mention it for planning&rsquo;s sake. </span

    if you have gotten ravenous because, let&rsquo;s face it, most of us become
    human Hoovers if we got desperation-level hungry. Based on the information
    above, you can see that speed eating does not allow the system to work the
    way it&rsquo;s designed to. So if you want your body to be able to
    accurately assess what it needs, try to eat slowly. </span

  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Eating to less-than-satisfied is not ideal (because it&rsquo;s
    uncomfortable) but sometimes is unavoidable if you plan to eat again soon
    (along with choosing something low in fat). Stopping before satisfied (or at
    least pausing) may be a good idea if you notice you are downing your pizza
    really fast (which I often can&rsquo;t help but do) and want to let your
    body catch up. </span

    >Other than that, don&rsquo;t let your brain get involved with chatting
    about whether you should or shouldn&rsquo;t take xyz into account, your body
    will adjust beautifully to more and less active days, and that&rsquo;s why
    it&rsquo;s FABULOUS that it seems like more food some days than other days
    gives you the satisfied feeling. That&rsquo;s the system working!

    >Many people ask if it&rsquo;s common to lose this ability to feel
    physically satisfied. Yes, it is.
    <strong
      >Being able to sense when you are hungry and full is dulled by using
      external means of food control for a long time, like counting calories,
      dieting, or eating what you are &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; by any
      program.</strong
    >
    Hormone and nerve function can also be disrupted by binge eating and
    purging. The signals can be blunted and muffled if instead of having clear
    meals with gaps between them a person grazes all the time (because you never
    actually are fed or fasting, you live in the middle), a place I call Hunger
    Purgatory. You don't feel hunger or satisfaction when you never GET all the
    way hungry or all the way satisfied.&nbsp;</span

    ><strong>The good news: It comes back.</strong> It comes back through eating
    regular meals on a consistent schedule, with spaces between them where you
    don&rsquo;t eat, letting your body heal from past abuses like binge eating
    and purging. But most of all, sensing these signals means listening, and
    practicing listening for a period of time, so you get better and better at
    hearing it.&nbsp; <br /><br /></span

      >The biggest interference for most people is their emotional reactions
      from restrictive eating.</strong
    >
    You can't tell how good you feel physically when emotional
    pain/comfort/shame/pleasure&nbsp;has the&nbsp;starring role in determining
    your food intake. Food takes on an enhanced reward value when it is
    restricted, and chronic wanting screams louder than physical satiety.&nbsp;
    Taking back the reins means giving your physical body the chief say in how
    much is enough, and it's a separate (and worthwhile)&nbsp;skill to maximize
    the enjoyment you get within that.&nbsp;</span

    >In closing, practicing Eating Just Enough can seem mind-exploding because
    it&rsquo;s an art. Just like coaching it, we&rsquo;ll never be
    &ldquo;done&rdquo; with perfecting our ability to do it. The beauty is in
    the communication that results from our efforts to do it as well as we can,
    and&nbsp;watching how we get better with time.</span
