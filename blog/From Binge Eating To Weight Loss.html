  As nutrition coaches, people come to us when they are stuck and not making
  progress. One particularly challenging and recurring example of this is people
  who struggle with binge eating and excess weight, both of which they would
  like to lose for good. It's not hard to see that binge eating (consuming
  objectively large amounts of food in a single sitting while feeling out of
  control) is counterproductive to weight loss. What's harder to see is why
  someone in this situation actually&nbsp;<em>shouldn't</em>&nbsp;try to work on
  both goals at the same time.

  <strong
    >Working on weight loss is counterproductive to binge eating recovery,
    however,</strong
  >&nbsp;<strong
    >binge eating recovery is the single best step toward weight loss and
    attaining a healthy weight</strong
  >.
</p>
<p>Is that a mind-bender or what? Let's explore.</p>
<p>
  Friends and families of our clients who fit this profile often know them as
  the Super Healthy Eaters, who never seem to eat any sweets, or maybe they are
  the strict Paleo dieter in their circle of friends. They may have "always been
  on a diet." But behind closed doors, all the restriction drops away at some
  moments, and hundreds or thousands of calories are eaten in numbing
  desperation.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes no one knows; Sometimes everyone suspects but no one says anything.
  And sometimes, other people&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;know and try to help, yet
  just don't know how.
</p>
<p>
  Binge eating and restriction become a frustrating cycle that batters a
  person's body and self-esteem. It feels like a prison of shame, where every
  escape attempt ends up back in the same place.
</p>
<p>
  One typical client, whom we'll call Beth (not her real name), despaired each
  time she looked in the mirror or tried on an outfit before work. The
  twenty-five extra pounds she saw in her reflection just didn&rsquo;t belong on
  the person she wanted to be. She described how she imagined her friends and
  colleagues wondering about her. After all, she gets up at 5 AM to workout
  intensely almost every single day, how come she isn&rsquo;t absolutely ripped?
  She felt like the extra weight on her body was saying she must have a secret
  eating life. They must think she has no willpower, she worried. She was
  disgusted with herself.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  She re-committed to sticking 100% to her very structured diet and vigorous
  exercise. She made rules for herself to make sure that she would stay in
  control and on-plan. If only she could follow her diet to the letter, then
  this time she would be successful. Day after day she logged her calories and
  macronutrients. She skipped the takeout place and eliminated all junk food.
  She didn't eat fruit (too much sugar) or nuts (too much fat). She stopped
  eating dairy and swore off gluten too because so many people said they were
  bad.
</p>
<p>
  Then one day as she walked home after a particularly stressful day at work,
  she became embroiled in some familiar thoughts. Overwhelm and unhappiness
  swirled all around her. She just wanted to feel better; desperately needed to
  escape this moment. There must be a release valve. Why not just get stop by
  the convenience store....one time doesn&rsquo;t matter. She could worry about
  it again tomorrow. Her palms started to sweat when she imagined the cold
  deliciousness of her favorite ice cream. Her heart raced.
</p>
<p>Once the floodgates opened she found herself eating uncontrollably.</p>
<p>
  She went through the ice cream and cookies she brought home, then ravaged the
  pantry. Cereal, peanut butter, even crackers she didn't really like. She felt
  like she was in a daze, unaware of what she was doing, or like it wasn&rsquo;t
  real. There was some relief that at least the tension about whether or not to
  binge was gone. The workday seemed far away, there was just food, food, and
  more food.
</p>
<p>
  However, waking the next day it was all too clear how real it was. Packages
  and crumbs littered the counters, evidence was all around. She felt sick,
  bloated, and demoralized as she cleaned. She wondered how she could do this
  yet again when she promised herself that this time would be different. It felt
  like she would never get rid of this problem. It wasn&rsquo;t even worth
  trying.

    >Beth&rsquo;s story illustrates how strict dieting as a way to control binge
    eating can backfire, but it&rsquo;s almost always the route people take when
    they are overweight and unhappy.</strong
  >&nbsp;After all, isn&rsquo;t the entire world of magazines and the internet
  telling us, if we want to lose weight we need to eat less and move more? Then
  why isn&rsquo;t it working? If we want desperately to lose fat, how can
  we&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;try and eat less?
</p>
<p>
  For someone with binge eating disorder or a habitual tendency to binge eat,
  cutting calories to encourage weight loss just stokes the fire of burning
  urges to binge. The stress of restraining and limiting food intake makes a
  person want to binge from a psychological trigger, while the state of drastic
  calorie deficit amplifies the physiological drive to eat uncontrollably.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Dieting is a one way street for someone who binge eats.</strong
  >&nbsp;Actually, it&rsquo;s more like a traffic circle, leading round and
  round, but never getting anywhere. Not to weight loss. Not to binge freedom,
  just endless circles of demoralization and shame.
</p>
<p>
  If you do have initial success with reducing calories, or even lose a few
  pounds, you feel excited! But often that confidence causes trouble. Perhaps
  you try to let yourself celebrate with a little treat&hellip; and it leads to
  a wipeout that erases any progress you made in weight loss and leaves you
  feeling hopeless (yet viciously motivated to get back on that diet and do it
  right this time.) Overeating followed by strong feelings of remorse as well as
  undereating can set you up for a vicious cycle. You might hear other people
  talk about hunger and satisfied feelings, but feel like you must be busted.
  You never feel like that, you just want unending quantities of food, so how
  would you ever lose weight unless you stay controlled?

  As glum as this scenario is, there is a different, more effective way to
  approach the problem.&nbsp;<strong
    >Instead of trying to accomplish two things at once: stopping
    bingeing&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;losing weight, we get great results because
    we separate the journey.</strong
  >&nbsp;The first step is to stop binge eating without attempting weight loss.
  Aiming for calorie balance gives someone the best possible set up to combat
  binge eating and&nbsp;<em>win</em>&nbsp;for a change. Life is hard enough,
  isn&rsquo;t it, without adding a calorie deficit to the mix? We all have
  pressures and stresses, emotional sore spots, and people who grate on us.
  Family issues, work concerns, identity, sex, finances&hellip;. There are
  plenty of emotional challenges which pose binge eating triggers, we believe
  you can cross intense hunger off the list for the first chapter. There&rsquo;s
  plenty of other tough stuff to learn to work through in the initial phase.
</p>
<h3>First, The Goal Is To Stop Bingeing</h3>
<p>
  For this portion, we follow the recommendations of the most widely studied and
  most successful treatment available based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. We
  also include elements of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to provide a
  framework for resilience in the face of difficult emotions. Equipped with
  tools and strategies to use for emotional management, the binge becomes an
  outdated coping mechanism. One that gets less and less use, and eventually
  gathers dust.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >The key components are to establish a pattern of regular eating and to
    practice detaching from urges to binge.</strong
  >&nbsp;Many people who binge eat are erratic eaters. They may skip breakfast
  or skip meals post-binge. Or perhaps they are trying to accomplish a
  low-calorie diet. This feast or famine eating can add to the physiological
  pressure to binge. To counteract this we recommend a regular eating schedule
  of 5-6 meals per day. These meals act as stepping stones to get you through
  the day binge-free. In this way, you are only a couple of hours at most from
  your next meal. This gives our bodies time to grow accustomed to an even,
  predictable feeding pattern, and to allow our natural hunger and satiety cues
  time to normalize.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Then, a period of time needs to pass for things to settle.</strong
  >&nbsp;Since they&rsquo;re new, the cognitive tools and self-regulation
  strategies need to be practiced, so they become easier to remember and grab at
  the right moment. After several weeks, of regularly spaced, normally-sized
  meals, the digestive tract and central nervous system have changed in a
  positive way. Frequent binge eating leads to distorted reward signaling in the
  brain, abnormal motility in the digestive tract (causing digestive symptoms
  such as pain, bloating, constipation), and a dulled or absent perception of
  hunger, satisfaction or fullness. Thankfully, each of these will improve
  during the recovery process, it just takes some time of normal, regular
  eating.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >Once the frequency of binge episodes have markedly subsided and stabilized,
    and the hunger and satisfaction signals have begun to emerge, it&rsquo;s
    finally time when weight loss is possible.</strong
  >&nbsp;It&rsquo;s difficult to be patient enough to get to this point, but the
  investment in mental and physical wellness allows a person to
  finally,&nbsp;<em>FINALLY,</em>&nbsp;escape that prison. If someone still
  wants to lose weight, in the third phase we gradually introduce weight loss
  habits using the successful Lean Habits system.
</p>
<p>
  As for the best weight-loss approaches, we recommend that&nbsp;you make
  changes that are sustainable and not exceedingly uncomfortable, we are not
  fans of the rapid or drastic approach for anyone. But for someone with a
  history of binge eating, sustainability and reasonableness are&nbsp;even more
  crucial, because the old coping mechanism of the binge might be gathering
  dust, but it&rsquo;s still there. Overwhelm, extreme physical discomfort or
  emotional pain can increase the urge to relapse. So it is important to protect
  yourself from unnecessary strain (like a 7-day juice fast) and treat yourself
  lovingly. You have time to lose any excess weight, there is no urgency, and
  managing your environment to eliminate avoidable triggers is wise. Your health
  and happiness are worth it, and by reaching this point you will have
  accomplished something extraordinary. It&rsquo;s well justified to treat
  yourself like a pretty amazing person, who has come through a hard road but
  stood strong and changed their life for the better.
