<p>
  Millions of busy adults suffer from food prep problems, which we're going to
  call "FPP." Are you one of them? Symptoms of FPP include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Possessing 3 or more items in your refrigerator which are furrier than your
    dog
  </li>
  <li>
    Not having the right things on hand to assemble a meal, so your order Pizza
    or Chinese
  </li>
  <li>
    Throwing out food on a weekly basis (that once would have been fine to eat)
  </li>
  <li>
    Overeating because you skipped a meal earlier (may cause paradoxical weight
    gain brought on by grocery shortage)
  </li>
  <li>
    Skipping meals during the workday because you&rsquo;re too busy to go out
    and don&rsquo;t have anything with you to eat
  </li>
  <li>
    Two items in your crisper have achieved sentience, and are battling for
    dominion over the lower refrigerator
  </li>
  <li>
    Your past google searches include &ldquo;How many weeks past the &lsquo;sell
    by&rsquo; date can I eat deli meat?&rdquo;
  </li>
  <li>Paleontologists have requested access to items in your freezer</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Maybe these are all familiar to you (sounds like you&rsquo;re afflicted)! Or
  maybe you&rsquo;re not quite that bad off but you toss out more food than
  you&rsquo;d like to, and get caught a time or two per month in a pinch, and
  don&rsquo;t eat as well as you could on those instances. Either way, here are
  some tips to help you do a little bit better at the logistics of food prep,
  which can help you manage your weight more easily, save some cash, avoid those
  long overly-hungry stretches (which aren&rsquo;t fun, to say the least) and
  last but not least, avoid missing out on fun things because you got food
  poisoning from decrepit lasagna.
</p>
<h3>1. You&rsquo;re Not A Bad Person For Throwing Out Food</h3>
<p>
  If you buy lots of fresh, whole foods and fall short of eating it all, of
  course you have to throw some out. It&rsquo;s still worth being proud of
  yourself for surrounding yourself with the good stuff. Tossing food is a much
  better alternative than swearing off the produce section or eating food that
  is unsafe &ldquo;to avoid wasting it." With some more practice, you&rsquo;ll
  get better at matching your purchasing habits to your consumption patterns,
  but all of us end up throwing things out sometimes. It&rsquo;s okay,
  we&rsquo;re all going to make it.

  /><br />2. You&rsquo;re Also Not A Bad Person For Not Knowing This Already
</h3>
<p>
  Some parents teach their kids kitchen skills, and some&hellip; don&rsquo;t.
  Some people pick up useful strategies from Home Economics class or some foodie
  roommate. A few lucky souls pair up with a food provider extraordinaire and
  marry their way into a steady supply of home cooking and lunches packed with
  love.
</p>
<p>
  But if you didn&rsquo;t get culinarily inclined parents, your roomies lived on
  ramen, and you and Martha Stewart just didn&rsquo;t hit it off&hellip; no one
  taught you. Don&rsquo;t fault yourself for being busy learning other things.
  No one springs from the womb, Saran-wrap in hand, ready to make next
  week&rsquo;s lunches this Sunday. We all start out not knowing, and we have to
  be taught or figure out the rest.
</p>
<h3>3. You Don&rsquo;t Have To Sacrifice Your Entire Weekend</h3>
<p>
  If you feel good spending several hours shopping, washing, slicing, and baking
  on a weekend day, rock on. But if you would rather do an extra 15 minutes
  every other night, that&rsquo;s plenty! Using your time and appliances wisely
  is key here, not investing hours.
</p>
<p>
  For example: Putting a pot of rice on to boil takes 2
  minutes&nbsp;<em>if&nbsp;</em>you&rsquo;re slow to measure out the rice and
  water. Then you can set a timer, walk away and do other stuff. About the same
  time would be needed to wrap some sweet potatoes in foil and pop them into the
  oven. Putting something in the slow cooker can be a similarly quick affair,
  and then you don&rsquo;t have to hang in the kitchen. You can even go to bed
  and wake up to stick it in the fridge. That&rsquo;s right, you can literally
  cook dinner with your eyes closed.

<h3>
  4. You Don&rsquo;t Need An Extensive Tupperware Set, $60 Lunch Box, Portable
  Cooler, Or Anything Weird
</h3>
<p>
  Just like investing lots of free time isn&rsquo;t the key, neither are pricey
  doo-dads. Some tin foil and parchment make for easy cleanup. Other than that,
  you just need food and basic kitchen appliances like a stove and oven.
</p>
<h3>5. Some Stuff Preps Well In Advance; Some Stuff Doesn&rsquo;t</h3>
<p>
  Soup, stews, meats, grains, and starches all work great to cook in advance.
  You can also prep veggies by rinsing or cutting them up ahead of time.
  However, there are a few things to steer clear of trying to do in advance:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Putting dressing on a lettuce or spinach salad ahead of time can make it
    soggy. Ditto for sandwiches, so you might want to wait until mealtime to add
    condiments. (Raw kale or cabbage salads however, can hold up better, so are
    possible exceptions.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Any crispy breaded or roasted items (like chicken fingers or crispy home
    fries) won&rsquo;t be crispy after storage. Sometimes they can be re-crisped
    using the oven or stovetop, but not always.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you like crunchy cereal or flaked almonds atop your yogurt? Me too. But
    don&rsquo;t add them ahead of time, because they will get soft and lose
    their crunch.
  </li>
  <li>
    I wouldn&rsquo;t consider this a &ldquo;deal breaker&rdquo;, because
    it&rsquo;s relatively minor and just cosmetic, but remember that cut apples,
    guacamole, and fresh basil or pesto tend to get brownish during storage.
  </li>
  <li>Reheat fish at your own risk. The texture can be unforgiving.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Some Foods Freeze Well; Some Don&rsquo;t</h3>
<p>
  Did you know that if you mistakenly bought too much milk you could just freeze
  it? You can! Pasta dishes, cooked grains, sauces, soups, and stews also tend
  to be great freezer candidates.
</p>
<p>
  But not everything can go in the icebox and come back to life with good
  results. Beware of freezing dairy-based sauces or soups, because they often
  separate. Fruits and veggies can be frozen, but will be much softer when you
  pull them out. Think of them as good for smoothies or omelets, but not for
  salads.
</p>
<h3>7. Never Cook A Single Piece Of Chicken, Or One Potato</h3>
<p>
  If you&rsquo;re going to the trouble of heating up the pan, the grill, or the
  oven, put several pieces on there so you have extra portions for coming days!
</p>
<h3>8. You Can Repeat Meals If You Want To, But It&rsquo;s Not Necessary</h3>
<p>
  By the third time I&rsquo;m eating a dish, the enjoyment has dropped
  precipitously. I&rsquo;ve done the huge-ass pot of chili you eat all week.
  I&rsquo;ve done massive egg bakes or frittatas. Oversized vegetable soups.
  Vats of stuffed cabbage. And if you enjoy one-pot meals (and don&rsquo;t mind
  reheating cooked eggs) these are perfectly fine meals for you to use.
  Personally, I find things a lot more enjoyable if I can make different meals
  from the components I cooked in advance.
</p>
<h3>
  9. If You Cook Basics Ahead Of Time, You Can Always Season Them Differently At
  Meal Time
</h3>
<p>
  A big pot of brown rice, half a dozen chicken breasts, four baked potatoes,
  two pounds of browned ground beef... These sorts of staples can go into a
  variety of different meals. The rice can be served plain or with soy sauce as
  a bed for stir-fry, be mixed with the ground beef filling for stuffed peppers,
  or be flavored with garlic and butter for a side dish.
</p>
<p>
  Chicken can be sliced atop a salad, put into a sandwich, cubed and tossed with
  pasta and sauce, or used to fill a quesadilla. Baked potatoes can be topped
  with salsa and black beans, chopped into a green salad, sauteed up for a side
  dish with eggs, or smothered in broccoli and cheese. Cooked ground beef can
  become stir-fry, bolognese tomato sauce, stuffed peppers, salad, or burritos.
</p>
<p>
  In general, starchy foods and proteins are best for prepping ahead of time.
</p>
<h3>10. Condiments, Seasonings, Canned goods, And Jars Are Your Friend</h3>
<p>
  They&rsquo;re smart, not inferior or lazy. When you have your pre-cooked
  proteins and starches on hand, putting a meal together comes down to doing
  something with some veggies and making it all tasty. Veggies can be cut up and
  eaten raw as a salad, or you can steam or saute them in about 5 minutes. That
  leaves us with flavoring.
</p>
<p>
  Having some sauces, salad dressings, and mixed seasonings on hand means
  you&rsquo;re set. Sure you can make your own, but again, you don&rsquo;t have
  to. I enjoy lots of bottled salad dressings and rarely make my own. Jarred
  pasta sauce, hot sauce, soy sauce, miso, ketchup, mustard, sesame oil, olive
  oil, lemon juice and vinegars can all help flavor your meal. Steak rub, Cajun,
  Italian, and Greek seasoning blends, lemon pepper, or Mrs. Dash can be added
  to already cooked meats to flavor them, or used on vegetables to give them
  some zing.
</p>

  />
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, despite their limited talent for pep-talk, canned beans are a
  fantastic teammate to have in your corner. If you run short on starches or
  don&rsquo;t feel like taking the time to boil pasta water or cook potatoes,
  open a can and you have a high fiber, vitamin-rich side dish. Some of the
  easiest ways to jazz up canned beans include stirring cumin and/or chili
  powder into black beans (add some cilantro if you have it), or mixing chana
  masala (an Indian spice blend), or tomato paste and curry powder with
  chickpeas. Frank&rsquo;s Red Hot and a squeeze of lime juice work with
  lentils, kidney beans or black beans. Rosemary and olive oil are a perfect
  pairing for white beans, such as Great Northern Beans or Cannellini. And all
  the flavors I mentioned above are shelf-stable things you can keep in your
  pantry for months or years. So buy them when you stock up on canned beans, and
  as long as you don&rsquo;t lose the can opener, your Plan B side dish is
  always ready.
</p>
<h3>Bonus Tip #11. Stay Safe.</h3>
<p>
  If you&rsquo;re cooking food to eat in the future, get it cooled down as soon
  as you can. Leftovers are safe for 3 or 4 days, but after that your risk of
  food poisoning increases. If you think you won&rsquo;t use something within
  four days, freeze it right away. When I am hesitating on a particular
  food&rsquo;s safety, making a judgment call on whether to taste something or
  toss it, I compare my dissatisfaction over throwing it out to my feelings on
  throwing it&nbsp;<em>up,</em>&nbsp;and that usually settles it decisively.
