<p>Your life has some problems in it.</p>
<p>As does mine. The world is full of problems.</p>
<p>
  Some of them we just accept because they don&rsquo;t seem solvable to us
  personally (world peace), or we know we could do something but it&rsquo;s not
  exactly a priority (example: my oven door hinge which has been broken for 19
  months and counting).
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >But then there are all of the problems we&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;want to do
    something about solving.</strong
  >&nbsp;As unpleasant as it may be, you probably will do your taxes, whether on
  your own or with a professional. If you get a flat tire on the car you need to
  get to work, you&rsquo;re going to get it fixed. The dog needs to be neutered
  for his health, so you call the vet to make an appointment.
</p>
<p>
  Some of these problems we have the choice to solve by doing the work ourselves
  (the taxes being a better example than the dog neutering), or hiring someone
  to do it for us. You can get out your receipts, pay a nominal fee for
  Turbotax, and work your way through filing a tax return. Alternately, you can
  provide your information to someone who will do it all for you.
</p>
<p>
  So there&rsquo;s an option, you can save some money by doing more work
  yourself, or spend more and have someone else do the tough part. You can make
  pizza yourself, or call and get a hot pizza delivered. You can mow your own
  lawn, or hire a landscaper to show up and make sure the hedge and grass are
  looking manicured on a regular basis.
</p>
<h3>Fitness and Weight Loss Are Different Problems</h3>
<p>
  Fitness and weight loss are not the kind of problems someone else can fix for
  you. You can&rsquo;t call the Ghostbusters. You can&rsquo;t call in a plumber.
</p>
<p>
  At first blush, you&rsquo;re probably thinking how obvious that is.
  You&rsquo;re a self-responsible person. Only a fool would think they could buy
  a slimmer body!
</p>
<p>
  Except, that is the marketing message you are going to be fed left, right and
  center from a multi-billion-dollar industry. We all are told in subtle ways
  that we can buy a supplement, hire a trainer, join a class, get an injection,
  drink a shake and our weight will disappear.
</p>
<p>
  If your excess weight was a puddle on the kitchen floor, diet and exercise
  products&nbsp;or programs&nbsp;make it sound like all you have to do is call
  in a pro, and consider it solved. You can imagine yourself stepping back while
  the plumber figures out what&rsquo;s wrong with your pipes, gets the necessary
  tools or parts, does the handy work, and gets rid of the puddle.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >I&rsquo;ll be honest with you: When it comes to your eating habits, you are
    going to have to fix the pipes yourself if you want the problem really
    solved.</strong
  >
</p>
<p>Not that there aren&rsquo;t other options.</p>
<p>
  You might stop using the sink, but that&rsquo;s really just skirting the
  problem and pretending it isn&rsquo;t there. A restrictive no-dairy, no-sugar,
  no-gluten plan sounds to me like advice to just stop using the sink.
  You&rsquo;re not fixing the overeating pattern you have with these foods,
  you&rsquo;re just avoiding them. Which is okay, if you don&rsquo;t miss using
  your sink.
</p>
<p>
  You can move out of your house and into a hotel, the &ldquo;weight loss
  resort&rdquo; method. Here you also don&rsquo;t have to deal with your own
  leaky pipes because you aren&rsquo;t using your sink, you&rsquo;ve borrowed
  someone else&rsquo;s. You&rsquo;re eating pre-portioned meals, there&rsquo;s
  no refrigerator to tempt you at 11 pm, you&rsquo;re probably off work and
  doing vacation things like massages and hiking all day. You can feel like your
  leaky plumbing is worlds away, and maybe it&rsquo;s even gone for good.
</p>
<p>
  But when you get home, and there&rsquo;s your job, and your fridge, and your
  real life, there is that dang puddle on the floor again.
</p>
<p>
  You can even find experts who suggest the solution is to refrain from using
  your sink 2 days out of the week, or only use it for a small window of time
  each day. These are just band-aids to mask the problem, they don&rsquo;t solve
  anything.
</p>
<p>
  Be wary if someone tells you they can fix your problem in a really fast period
  of time. Especially if they haven&rsquo;t gotten to know you and your current
  problem. &ldquo;Lose the weight in 6 weeks&rdquo; is like getting a 45-minute
  guarantee on fixing your plumbing problem, when no has even looked at it to
  see what it is. You&rsquo;re probably getting lied to, or you&rsquo;re going
  to get a shoddy, temporary, band-aid fix.
</p>
<p>
  So you realize you are going to have to learn stuff. You&rsquo;re going to
  have to look in dark places, like what&rsquo;s behind the bucket of dish soap
  pods under the counter, and why you feel the way you do when you&rsquo;re
  alone.
</p>
<p>
  But you don&rsquo;t have to do it by yourself. You can get help, step by step,
  to determine what the exact problem is, what tools you need, and where to get
  them. You can learn by reading, by watching videos, and from talking to other
  people who are working on patching up their sinks too. Not everyone&rsquo;s
  leak is coming from the same issue, maybe it&rsquo;s your garbage disposal or
  a rotten seal, but that&rsquo;s okay because no matter what exact gap is
  causing your leak, there are tools and directions and you have time to fix it.
  The queen isn&rsquo;t coming over for tea tomorrow, and there&rsquo;s no shame
  in imperfect plumbing.
</p>
<p>
  So have heart, even if all the products and pills and programs and meal plans
  didn&rsquo;t work. If you need free information on how to figure out where
  your leak is, what steps to take to solve the real problem, we&rsquo;ve got
  that for you. It makes us feel good to know that people aren&rsquo;t running
  away from their problems, thinking they are too scary or difficult to remedy.
  That's why we put in the work to create and provide a free library of complete
  courses to help you learn exactly what you need, and we're here every step of
  the way if you need an extra hand.
</p>
<p>You've got this.</p>
