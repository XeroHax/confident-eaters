<p>
  A lot of things aren&rsquo;t ideal about working the night shift, but you knew
  that already.
</p>
<p>Noting being able sleep is obviously the big one.</p>
<p>
  But then there&rsquo;s also the wacky nausea-hunger hybrid you get when
  you&rsquo;re suuuuuper tired. There&rsquo;s the fact that nothing but candy
  can sound good at 2 am, and you brought tuna salad for &ldquo;lunch&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the crazy hunger the following day.</p>
<p>And the heartburn from too much coffee.</p>
<p>
  If you work some day shifts too, there&rsquo;s a weird long day and a weird
  short day on either side of your night shift as you transition into and out of
  vampire schedule.
</p>
<p>
  There certainly are a handful of challenges, but don&rsquo;t make the mistake
  of confusing difficulty for impossibility. It&rsquo;s not impossible to eat
  nutritiously or practice healthy habits with night shift work, you just need a
  system.
</p>
<h3>
  Trick 1: Don&rsquo;t Think About &ldquo;Eating 3-4 Meals a Day&rdquo;; Think
  About Eating Every 4-6 Hours You are Awake.
</h3>
<p>
  This switch will help you manage the days you have during which you&rsquo;re
  awake a lot longer than usual, as well as the short days where you might only
  need to eat twice. If you work a 24-hour call shift at a hospital (medical
  residents, I salute you), then take 4 substantial meals, at least. You might
  feel like you&rsquo;re over-packing when you schlep a suitcase-sized cooler
  bag into the office, but not bringing enough food is the number one culprit in
  night shift nutrition problems. And the food available at night is often
  limited to vending machines, so consider bringing lots of healthy food as an
  investment in candy-prevention.
</p>
<p>
  If you&rsquo;re working for 24 hours, I suggest planning to eat breakfast,
  lunch, dinner and a meal in the middle of the night. If you eat breakfast at
  home before leaving for work, that means packing up THREE meals to bring with
  you and having breakfast the following day at home before collapsing into bed.
</p>
<p>
  If your shift is a more normal 8-12 hour stretch, you&rsquo;ll probably be
  bringing one or two meals with you to work.
</p>
<h3>
  Trick 2: Make Sure to Include a Protein, Fruit or Vegetable, and Some Fat.
</h3>
<p>
  This tenet is unchanged, whether you are eating at night or eating during the
  day. If you want to lose weight, then maximizing your appetite satisfaction at
  every opportunity just makes sense, and it takes all the major macronutrients
  to accomplish this. Even if weight management is not on your mind, steady
  energy and blood sugar is reason enough to balance your meals out. Here are
  some examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eggs, whole wheat toast with butter, and a grapefruit.</li>
  <li>Spinach and feta omelet, English muffin, strawberries</li>
  <li>
    Ham and Swiss sandwich, side of raw carrots, bell peppers, and radishes with
    dip
  </li>
  <li>Turkey, spinach and avocado wrap with a bag of grapes</li>
  <li>
    Lentil soup, side salad, and a protein bar Chicken and veggie stir fry with
    brown rice
  </li>
  <li>Pasta with zucchini and meat sauce, an apple</li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Trick 3: A Sweet Flavor Profile Goes Down Easier at Night. Plan Accordingly.
</h3>
<p>
  I can only imagine how many tupperwares of leftover lasagna, tacos or soup
  have languished in lunch bags while their owner noshed on Snickers bars and
  cookies in the wee hours of the morning. Sweet stuff is often more palatable
  than savory meals, as demonstrated by many children who were
  &ldquo;full&rdquo; of green beans but had room for ice cream. But at night,
  this differential widens to the point that it&rsquo;s not even a fair contest.
  It&rsquo;s an uphill battle for many night shift workers to eat
  &ldquo;normal&rdquo; meals when they are very tired, and sweet carby things
  are calling. You can still make your meals balanced, even if they are on the
  sweeter side. Fruit, yogurt, and oatmeal are helpful here. It is absolutely
  fine to take a pass on veggies at this one, in the name of actually enjoying
  your food (and not resorting to the vending machine).
</p>
<p>
  Here are some more examples of portable meals which are easy to eat even on an
  overnight:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Cut up pears or peaches (or other fruit), some almonds or cashews, and
    cottage cheese
  </li>
  <li>Greek yogurt, granola, flaxseed and banana (or other fruit)</li>
  <li>
    Oatmeal with milk, protein powder, a cut up apple, and cinnamon mixed in
  </li>
  <li>
    Made ahead Kodiak Cakes power cakes (high protein pancake mix) with cut
    fruit and nut butter
  </li>
  <li>
    A large whole wheat tortilla spread with peanut butter and sliced banana,
    plus an individual Greek yogurt
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Trick 4: Keep Comforting Things on Hand</h3>
<p>
  Nights&nbsp;are hard. A furry blanket, a hot cup of tea or sugar-free hot
  cocoa, your favorite playlist of tunes, or a book can all make things feel a
  little better when they are at their hardest. Leaving tea bags and hot drink
  mix at your desk or locker is an easy start. Maybe some fleecy socks would be
  nice too? Be creative and think proactively about how you can comfort and
  nurture yourself; it will pay off greatly in helping you avoid comfort eating
  when you aren&rsquo;t actually hungry.
</p>
<p>
  We hope that having these tricks in hand helps you feel more confident about
  eating well, no matter what hours you happen to be working. Remember to share
  it with any of your friends who might benefit from these tips!
