                A: One of the best way to get past a sugar craving is to not
                engage with it, not give into it, just keep living your life.
                Many people&nbsp;say they&nbsp;are plagued with
                cravings&nbsp;after eating too much candy on Halloween or
                Christmas, but within a day or so&nbsp;of getting rid of
                the&nbsp;candy (or those darn leftover cookies!) and reducing
                their sugar intake, the idea fades and they are fine enjoying
                their usual healthy whole foods. <br /><br />So think of these
                cravings as short-lived, and you'll come out the other side
                soon!&nbsp;<br /><br />You might find that less-intense sweet
                things, like flavored yogurt or fresh fruit are enjoyable
                without being so habit-forming and craving-inducing than
                manufactured&nbsp;processed foods (which are designed to give a
                maximal dopamine hit). I also find using sugar free hot cocoa or
                something&nbsp;sweetened&nbsp;with&nbsp;low calorie
                sweetener&nbsp;is useful as a helping hand in getting&nbsp;the
                sweet taste without the triggering the thoughts of "more, more
                more!" (Sugarless sweeteners can be rewarding to the brain but
                are less potently reinforcing&nbsp;than&nbsp;sugar)(1).&nbsp;<br /><br />You
                can also experience the craving differently, by relabeling
                it&nbsp;as "my brain wants a reward". When you&nbsp;treat the
                sensation this way, candy or sugar isn't the only answer, you
                can go get your heart rate up with some exercise, meditate, play
                a video game, or play some music, all of which&nbsp;can also
                trigger the same reward circuits and relieve the craving (2-5).
                It never hurts to find some romantic action either, if the time
                and place are right (6).&nbsp;
