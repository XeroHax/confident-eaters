  Being unable to exercise can be a truly miserable circumstance. It usually
  happens for reasons which are themselves unpleasant (we&rsquo;re sick,
  injured, had surgery, or life is just nuts with commitments and we&rsquo;ve
  got no time to tend to our own needs). Additionally, it&rsquo;s tougher to
  cope with these stresses if breaking a sweat is your normal stress-relief
  practice! If you then pile on the feeling of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting fatter
  and weaker by the day&hellip;&rdquo; it&rsquo;s pretty dismal.&nbsp;<img

  I've been there. More times than I like to think about. At times I thought I
  couldn't take it. And one could argue that my sanity was questionable, because
  after all, there I was crutching up and down my boyfriend's driveway<em>
    in the snow</em
  >
  after ACL surgery. Being inside and immobile was a pain greater than
  the&nbsp;impressively intense signals coming from my severed and stitched
  flesh.&nbsp;

    >If you find yourself injured, sick, or for some other reason barred from
    getting our usual fitness on, here's a hug. And some hope. You aren&rsquo;t
    totally powerless here, and I&rsquo;ll share with you some strategies which
    can help you get through that time while maintaining as much of your fit
    body as you can.&nbsp;</span

</p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400">Tune into your appetite</span></h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >You may have noticed your appetite increases when you boost your activity.
    Work out hard twice a day? You&rsquo;ll be hungry! Spend the entire day
    hiking in the Rockies? You&rsquo;ll be ready for some serious chow when
    dinnertime rolls around. That same mechanism also works in the opposite
    direction, only we don&rsquo;t notice it as much because the absence of
    hunger is a lot less attention-grabbing than roaring hungries.&nbsp;</span

</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >When you reduce activity, your appetite will ask for less food. It may not
    happen the first day, but within 2-3 days it definitely will have adjusted
    downward. If you continue to eat just like you always did (assuming that was
    maintenance), and are burning fewer calories now, that&rsquo;s where you
    could see weight gain start to happen. So use your hunger to cue you. Start
    the day with breakfast, and then don&rsquo;t eat again until you&rsquo;re
    clearly hungry. Alternately, try planning out your meals in advance if that
    fits your schedule/life/control addiction and see if when you follow that
    plan if you are in fact hungry for each meal. If you aren&rsquo;t, take a
    bit of food out of the preceding meal.&nbsp;</span

</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >If you are hungry for each meal, relax. You&rsquo;re doing well. Just keep
    your awareness up and let your hunger lead the way.&nbsp;</span

</p>

  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Dial back on your carbohydrates&nbsp;&nbsp;</span
  >
</h1>
<p>
  When you reduce activity, you don&rsquo;t need as many carbohydrates. You
  don&rsquo;t have to slash them all, (let&rsquo;s not get drastic here, OK?)
  but try dialing back your normal portions of starchy foods to get that
  hungry-before-each-meal and keeping the same amount of other stuff. The
  vitamins and minerals in fruits and veggies are important for health, and as
  we&rsquo;ll cover in a moment, you want plenty of protein. But you can have
  less rice, bread, oats, or pasta. Please don&rsquo;t read that as
  &ldquo;Georgie said to stop eating carbs.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s BS, you do not
  need to exercise to eat carbohydrate-rich foods, you just need more of them
  when you are exercising regularly than when you aren&rsquo;t! Even with zero
  activity (laying in bed), I still recommend my clients and patient have a
  couple servings a day of whole grains or starchy food like potatoes, beans,
  bread,&nbsp;or oats. It helps keep your intestinal flora happy and varied,
  aids in gut motility, and provides variety to the diet.&nbsp;
</p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400">Keep your protein intake high</span></h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Even if you aren&rsquo;t lifting weights, a high protein intake can help
    you retain muscles during a period of inactivity (or less activity). How
    high? Aim for 2 grams of protein per kilogram bodyweight, or just under a
    gram per pound you weigh. The source is not important, so feel free to use
    eggs, meat, chicken, fish, yogurt, cottage cheese, protein powder, or
    chocolate chip cookie dough Quest bars. Just get your protein
    in.&nbsp;</span

<h1>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Sleep as much as you can</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span>
</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >I know, if you aren&rsquo;t able to train because of a massive life
    implosion of catastrophic proportions, sleep ain&rsquo;t going to happen
    much either. But if you&rsquo;re recovering from ACL surgery or the flu, on
    vacation with no weights, or just have a busted shoulder and have been told
    to lay off, shuteye is totally doable, and will help with retaining your
    lean mass. How&rsquo;s that? Well, we know sleep is a powerful agent in
    modifying our endocrine system and how our bodies respond to stress. Sleep
    helps regulate the levels and activity of testosterone, growth hormone,
    ghrelin and leptin. Reduced time sleeping is one factor that increases
    stress hormones, a situation which favors breaking down muscle tissue, less
    insulin sensitivity, and shuttling any excess calories around into visceral
    fat (belly fat). So take whatever steps you need to get your sleep. If
    you&rsquo;re dealing with illness or injury your immune system and healing
    will benefit as well. </span

  &nbsp;An unplanned layoff&nbsp;is among the toughest times for an athlete
  mentally, so give yourself compassion and understanding, it's okay to be
  upset. It's a hard time, and it won't last forever. Allow yourself to feel
  what you feel, and then get back to what we athletes do: doing what we can to
  better ourselves.&nbsp;
