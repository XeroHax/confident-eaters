    when we can discuss the pro&rsquo;s and con&rsquo;s evenly. When you know
    all the possible likely impacts on both sides, you can keep an eye out for
    what is actually happening in your life and if calorie counting is the
    option you want to take.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img

</p>
<h1>
  Here are some of the reasons why calorie counting can be beneficial:&nbsp;
</h1>
<p>
  <strong
    >Calorie counting teaches you what food are high or low in calories.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    Sometimes it is genuinely surprising to see how fast the calories add up in
    say Chinese food or almond butter, and what a gigantic salad you can make
    for relatively few calories. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong>Counting calories helps you really grasp how things add up.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    Seeing that you actually have hundreds of calories just from condiments, or
    in your coffee each week can give you some useful perspective.</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong>If done properly, calorie counting teaches portion control.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    Hopefully if you are counting calories you are weighing, measuring, or
    otherwise carefully monitoring your food portions. That can be eye opening.
    What you assumed was a 200 calorie bowl of cereal might actually be a 400 or
    500 calorie bowl of cereal once you measure your usual serving.</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong
    >It teaches you to think about total calories, not good/bad foods or
    avoiding certain types.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    I remember when I was about twelve or so I learned that calories were
    actually the important commodity which would determine gaining or losing
    weight. However, not everyone has caught on, or they have lost sight of the
    fact that calorie deficit is the only way to lose fat.&nbsp; Some people are
    still convinced that to lose weight a person needs to eat organic food,
    avoid animal products, slash carbohydrates or avoid gluten. Wrong. It's
    about calories.</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong
    >When you are using calorie counting as your weight management strategy, you
    can work in any food.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    If you really want a Snickers bar, you can eat a Snickers bar, log it and
    account for the calories in your daily total. Compared to diets which ban
    certain items, this freedom is a big plus.</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong>Calorie counting is free.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    There are a ton of free apps you can use. Even without a smartphone, you can
    do a lot of it online. Something? I feel very strongly about is that a
    healthy weight should be accessible to everyone, no matter their income or
    gadget ownership.</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong>Counting up calories gives you instant feedback. </strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Humans thrive on feedback. It's nice to be able to look at your calorie
    total and instantly know if you are on track or not. But more on this
    below.</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >You may have read the above points and be thinking "well, I should download
    an app and get going counting calories now!" But that might not be the best
    idea because it's not a perfect method. Let's look at some of the drawbacks
    to counting calories, or why it&rsquo;s not for everyone.</span
  >
</p>
<h1>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Here are some reasons calorie counting can be harmful</span
  >
</h1>
<p>
  <strong
    >Counting calories can take your focus away from optimal macro
    splits.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    Your macronutrient intake -- the amount of carbohydrates, fat, and protein
    you consume -- can be a powerful tool in managing hunger. If you are only
    focused on total calories, then you might not take in appropriate amounts of
    protein, fiber, or fat to keep hunger at bay. This can leave you feeling
    like you just can't possibly eat less, or just can't stick to your goal
    calories, when in reality you could IF you were choosing foods differently. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong
    >Focusing on calories can subtly nudge you toward consuming more processed
    foods.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    Partially because they have a nutrition facts label right on them. It's
    often convenient and easy to scan the barcode on the bag or box to retrieve
    the calorie information instantly. On the other hand, if you choose to make
    a salad or stir fry from unprocessed ingredients like vegetables, beans,
    fruit and nuts, you have to look up each item individually. This makes it
    much easier to eat and enter a 100 calorie granola bar then try to make a
    100 calorie side salad and look up 9 different ingredients. Choosing more
    processed foods, as you probably know, is not as nutritious or appetite
    satisfying. But it's a time saver when you count calories so beware of that
    silent influence. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong
    >Calorie counting can make it stressful to choose and eat foods.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    Food is not an emotionally empty topic for too many people. Food is wrapped
    up with our self esteem, our traditions, our personal history, and our mood.
    Deciding what to eat from a restaurant menu can be stressful if you are
    trying to compose a meal that fits your target number of calories. You can
    feel like you're torn between what you want to eat and how many calories you
    have left.</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong
    >If there aren't any nutrition facts available, trying to guess how many
    calories are on your plate can be really distressing if you don't want to
    take chances with your weight loss!</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    And after putting in all the work to account for meal after meal, I can't
    blame someone for not wanting to roll the dice and just guess when they
    suddenly can't get the info. For example, you go to a wedding, how do you
    manage to track calories? Ask ahead of time how many ounces of potato are in
    the main course? Or spend the whole reception logging how many crackers,
    cherry tomatoes and hummus you ate during cocktail hour, while seeing how
    many calories you have left to eat dinner have cake? And what if you save
    all your calories for cake but then its red velvet, and you HATE red velvet. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong>It can strain relationships.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    No joking. Calorie counters can be, well, distracted during dinner
    conversation. Sharing food freely can suddenly be tense, because if you
    allotted yourself 30 grams of pretzels exactly and your boyfriend wants
    some, and takes a big handful... It could get ugly. (Um, that&rsquo;s a
    scene out of my not written biography. The time I bit someone&rsquo;s head
    off for eating too many of my pretzels. I&rsquo;m not proud.) </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong
    >Calorie counting can take your focus away from paying attention to whether
    you are hungry or not. </strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >This may be the biggest drawback about counting calories. Over and over I
    work with people whose excess weight is directly caused by years of eating,
    snacking, grazing, and tasting without hunger being considered at all. Often
    my clients had experience counting calories for large swaths of time, which
    did no good in resolving the underlying problems or their weight
    struggles</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong>It takes skill and time to count calories.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    Do you have an extra hour a day to weigh, measure, and portion your food,
    log each item in the app that you plan to eat, and edit it later if you
    didn't eat every bite, or added something? Do you want to use your spare
    time for that instead of other things?</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong>It's easily done wrong.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    If I look at someone's calorie log, I can point out that 250 milliliters of
    milk doesn't actually have the number of calories that shows in their diary,
    so they were off by a big margin. I can also spot if they picked an
    erroneous entry because the numbers don't look right on that steak, or eggs,
    or yogurt they logged. It is part of my career to know the nutrient
    information for many many foods. But if it's not yours, you can easily pick
    the wrong entry and be off by 1000 calories, even if you weigh every single
    thing you eat. And yes that can completely derail your progress. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong>Calorie amounts in foods vary extensively in natural foods. </strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >The grapefruit you ate yesterday could have more or fewer calories than the
    one you ate today. The steak you got might be fattier than the one
    represented by the numbers you see when you look it up. Nutrition labels are
    not highly precise, either. Even on mass produced food products, they can be
    over or under by as much as 20%. Databases online are often way off.</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong
    >A calorie counting lifestyle just doesn't jive well with eating
    out.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    The calorie figures report for their menu items are ballpark estimates at
    best. And sometimes no information is available.</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong
    >Aiming for the same calorie intake every day guarantees error.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    Not only will you need to adjust your calorie intake if you want to
    accommodate exercise, but having slightly higher and slightly lower intakes
    is a normal variation because your output varies day to day. Throughout the
    menstrual cycle, a woman's energy expenditure rises and falls slightly.
    Everything from the amount of walking you do to the temperature of your
    office to whether you have a cold can change the amount of calories you burn
    from day to day. Variation in the bacterial species in your gut can even
    change how efficiently you absorb calories from food and this can shift week
    to week. All these factors together can mean you get less of a deficit some
    days than you are aiming for, or no deficit at all.&nbsp;</span

</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >Counting calories as a long term weight loss strategy can lead to
    repetitive eating. </strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >For the same reasons that eating processed food makes life easier, having
    the same breakfast every day and the same lunch makes it easier to enter the
    data because you can copy meals from day to day. But a repetitive eating
    pattern makes life boring and can actually impede your weight loss. Not
    getting enough enjoyment from a person's regular meals typically leads to
    eating extra treats or seeking fun foods for some variety. Not to mention,
    dietary variety is one factor that contributes to gut biome diversity and
    health.&nbsp;</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong>Lastly, being on a calorie limit drives up the value of food.</strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    In the same way that scarcity of a commodity like oil or real estate drives
    up its price, having a scarcity of food impacts behavioral economics. After
    experiencing food scarcity, people naturally respond by overeating, binge
    eating, hoarding food, and having a harder time resisting immediate
    gratification. Does this sound like what you've experienced only after you
    started dieting? Clearly, you can see that these behaviors only create
    additional challenges for controlling weight the rest of your life. By
    telling yourself you &ldquo;only have 300 calories left&hellip;.&rdquo; you
    are creating a set up in which you will constantly want more.
    <strong
      >This means if you stop counting calories, with no other system in place
      to guide you on how much to eat, you WILL overeat.</strong
    >
    (Don't fear, you can learn other ways, though to prevent this such as in the
    free materials on our site).&nbsp;</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >In the end, there is no &ldquo;should&rdquo; or &ldquo;have to&rdquo;. I am
    not saying you &ldquo;should start&rdquo; or &ldquo;should stop&rdquo;
    counting calories. And you definitely do not &ldquo;have to count&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;have to stop&rdquo;. What is best, I feel, is to share as much
    information as I can for you to consider, plus invite you to add in your own
    experience. Is it working, or is it something you just feel like you should
    do? Have you considered the alternatives?&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >&nbsp;What matters&nbsp;above all else is what you want. If you want to
    count calories and it&rsquo;s is leading to your success in weight loss,
    continuing it seems logical. If you want to be better at managing your
    weight without counting calories, there are lots of ways to do that as well.
    You truly have the autonomy to decide how you want to live your food life,
    and whatever it is you want, I encourage you to make it
    happen.&nbsp;</strong
