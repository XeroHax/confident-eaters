    Dear Georgie,<br />My husband is starting the&nbsp;keto&nbsp;diet! On the
    bright side, I think this will make some things easier for me because he
    will be watching what he is eating and having less temptations around. But
    I'd love some reading on this, either for my knowledge or anything I should
    have him read. I'm concerned about his health. - Joan

<p>Dear Joan,</p>
<p>
  I agree that it will be helpful to you and your goals that your husband is
  choosing to do watch his intake, even if his approach isn't the same as yours.
  Your home will likely have fewer temptations, (especially alcohol and sweets)
  and hopefully, it will help him with the results he wants to see. Maybe he'll
  start cooking more!
</p>

  There are a lot of ways to do a low carb diet. A&nbsp;keto&nbsp;lunch might be
  a salmon filet and green salad with pecans.... or it might be bacon wrapped
  steak with butter-blue cheese sauce on it. If a person includes a lot of
  vegetables and chooses healthier fats and proteins, it's not that bad
  health-wise.
</p>
<p>
  The elements which&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;(but don't have to) make a low carb
  diet detrimental to health include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Low intake of fiber</strong>&nbsp;(constipation is common)&nbsp;<img
      src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/blogs/7985/images/z5w5oUsxQ26mJOYJwhJi_2009996.jpeg"
      width="207"
      height="207"
    />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Low intake of fruits and vegetables</strong>&nbsp;(especially during
    the first phase when carbohydrate intake is very limited, you can't even
    have all the vegetables you want.) Vegetable intake is correlated with
    longer, healthier lives, less cancer,&nbsp;and lower cardiovascular disease.
    So I get your concern here if your spouse is going to dial them way
    back!&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>High fat intake</strong>. Diets which are higher than about 40%
    calories from fat are causally linked to the development of insulin
    resistance, leptin resistance, obesity, increased appetite and decreased
    satiety, increased inflammation, and unhealthy changes in gut flora which
    increase risk for further weight gain and abdominal pains/digestive pain
    when fibers or carbohydrates are reintroduced. (a-j).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Decreases in mental well-being</strong>&nbsp;(some but not all
    studies have found that low carbohydrate intake is related to worse moods).
    (k, l) Sorry, but you might be dealing with a moody mister for a little
    while!&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>Impaired athletic ability (particularly speed/power) (m, n).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The first 3 you can do something about by making specific choices within
  the&nbsp;keto&nbsp;parameters, but the last 2 are directly due to low
  carbohydrate intake, and you can't raise carbohydrate intake and be on
  the&nbsp;keto&nbsp;diet.
</p>
<p>
  To maximize fiber: encourage him to get as many vegetables as the phase will
  allow. Use avocado for&nbsp;much&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;fats in your meals,
  since it also provides a good amount of fiber. Chia and flax seeds can also
  help provide fiber without many digestible carbohydrates. Don't use
  carbohydrate allowances for sugars or white bread. Use them for plants!
</p>

<p>
  To minimize the health risks of a high fat diet,&nbsp;it's best if he
  doesn't&nbsp;go sky high in fat (you don't have to put butter in your coffee).
  Other good ideas for a health-promoting keto diet would be to include seafood
  twice a week, choose more olive oil, nuts and avocado and&nbsp;little&nbsp;or
  no fatty red meat (bacon, hamburger, steak), and use cheese and butter less
  often.
</p>
<p>
  A Mediterranean diet pattern including 1-3 tablespoons (15-45 mL) of olive oil
  every day has been shown to improve triglycerides and markers of inflammation,
  so think in spoonfuls, not glugs straight from the bottle (o).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Also, if the individual is in a calorie deficit (calorie deficit = weight
  decreasing) then the risks to cholesterol levels and blood lipids are reduced.
  Even an "artery-clogging diet" doesn't have so many damaging effects on a
  person if they are losing weight, because the weight loss benefits to blood
  lipids are very significant.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, while it's not a physical health issue, dietary monotony and
  restriction can be&nbsp;damaging&nbsp;for mental health and a person's
  relationship with food. Being unable to eat bread, beans, rice, desserts, etc
  isn't something most people are willing to do forever, so they do
  the&nbsp;keto&nbsp;thing for a while and within 1 to 3 months, most people are
  back to eating carbs.
</p>
<p>
  So to "bring out the best" of this phase, I'd try to emphasize some helpful
  diet skills that your husband can practice and maintain, even after the diet
  is over. Even if he doesn't stay on a low carb or keto diet forever (most
  people don't) he can practice cooking and enjoying vegetables in place of
  starches with dinner, looking for high fiber foods, reading food labels,
  appreciating whole foods, and getting in a habit of choosing olive oil,
  avocado and seafood frequently.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Best of luck to you both! Feel free to pass on the links below or send a link
  to this article.<br /><br />(I don't recommend the keto diet, that's probably
  clear, but everyone gets to make up their own mind about which dietary
  strategies they adopt. If you want to know what I do recommend, head over to
