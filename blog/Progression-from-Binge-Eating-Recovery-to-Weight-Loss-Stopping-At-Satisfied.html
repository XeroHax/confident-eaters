    >Have you ever seen memes of "cake decorating fails?" They crack me up. If
    you don't know what I'm talking about, I'll explain. Cake decorating has
    pretty much become fine art, there are professionals who rival Michelangelo
    with what they can sculpt out of frosting. I&rsquo;m talking roses that look
    completely lifelike, cakes that look like unicorns, cakes with ice skating
    penguins on top&hellip; it&rsquo;s incredible!&nbsp;</span

</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    Cake decorating <em>fails</em> are the hilarious photos of what happens when
    average non-Michelangelo&rsquo;s try to decorate cake like one of the
    masters. A cake that&rsquo;s supposed to look like a smiling Disney princess
    comes out looking like a grimacing monster. A cake that&rsquo;s supposed to
    be a cute little Easter lamb looks like roadkill. They often put the
    &ldquo;expectation&rdquo; on the left, which is the pretty princess cake,
    and &ldquo;reality&rdquo; on the right&rdquo; which is the drunk gargoyle
    looking result. If you have nothing to do today, and you want a laugh, go
    google &ldquo;cake fails&rdquo;. You can thank me later. <br />
    <br />
    So why am I taking cake fails on the&nbsp;blog today? Because Stopping at
    Satisfied is a pristine example of where expectations looks one way, and
    reality often looks really really different. Today we&rsquo;ll talk about
    the progression people go through, because I know that hearing about the
    steps will save you lots of frustration on your journey as you break up with
    binge eating.<br /><br />
    Expectation versus reality. In my book
    <a
      href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Habits-Lifelong-Weight-Loss/dp/1624141129/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="
      >Lean Habits for Lifelong Weight Loss</a
    >, chapter 3 is titled <em>Eating Just Enough</em>. The concept is simple
    enough - most rational adults can see how it aids weight loss to eat enough
    but not any extra. However, I know, and more than 10,000 readers also know,
    that eating just enough is not as easy as deciding to stop at satisfied and
    then stopping at satisfied. It is SO NOT that simple. <br />
    <br />
    So on the left, we have expectation: "Step 1, I&rsquo;ll decide to stop at
    satisfied, step 2, I&rsquo;ll stop at satisfied at each meal, and boom,
    weight loss!"&nbsp; And then on the right, we have reality, which is vastly
    more complicated. There are slips where you overeat, they are slips when you
    under-eat, there are stressful moments, there are times you notice when
    you&rsquo;re full and keep eating anyway, and there will be times you blaze
    right past satisfied without ever noticing until much much later. <br />
    <br />
    It&rsquo;s this complicated for almost everyone, even people who
    haven&rsquo;t struggled with binge eating. For our clients who are working
    to recover for binge eating - I&rsquo;ll be frank, the process can have even
    more steps. But it&rsquo;s possible all the same, and I hear from people
    every week who say &ldquo;OMG I FINALLY AM DOING IT, it&rsquo;s took 8.5
    months&rdquo;, or &ldquo;it took 2 years!&rdquo; and they common thing is
    they are really happy they didn&rsquo;t give up. <br />
    <br />
    You might not be at the absolute beginning of this progression, but for the
    sake of the podcast, we&rsquo;ll assume you are. You might have a head start
    and be a bit further along, but if you are a total newbie at using satiety
    signals, here&rsquo;s where we begin. <br />
  </span>
</p>
<h2 class="p1">
  <span class="s1">1. Know what you&rsquo;re looking for.</span>
</h2>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    Satisfied is the feeling that we get after hunger goes away, if we keep
    eating, but before we get uncomfortably full. It&rsquo;s a range more than
    one specific bite. Your goal is just to notice when you&rsquo;re in the
    range. You probably feel more relaxation in your body, and you may even have
    a small sigh. Try to notice this feeling, but giving yourself complete
    permission to keep right on eating if you want to. At this stage, it&rsquo;s
    not about how much you eat, it&rsquo;s about how much you tune in and
    notice.&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<h2 class="p3">
  <span class="s1"
    >2. Notice the feeling when you are satisfied, and insert a pause.
  </span>
</h2>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"
    >We recommend 30 seconds to one minute. Drink some water, take a few deeps
    breaths, wipe your mouth with your napkin and converse for a second before
    you resume eating. Again, totally fine if you keep eating and even if you
    overeat, the goal here is to take the pause. If you paused, you nailed it,
    regardless of where the meal ended up.
  </span>
</p>
<h2 class="p3">
  <span class="s1">3. Try to eat less far into the red zone. </span>
</h2>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"
    >I use the term red zone to describe the range of feelings we get after
    satisfied. As you&rsquo;ve probably found, you can eat until you&rsquo;re a
    little too full, or a lot too full, or even until you feel sick and in pain.
    If you regularly eat until you are very far into the red zone, notice
    what&rsquo;s going on and put on your creative hat to see if you can make
    the smallest shift to go less far into the red zone. Using portion
    techniques can be a big help in this phase. If the amount of food you put on
    your plate takes you into a state of feeling quite stuffed, maybe put just a
    little less on your plate, reassuring yourself that you&rsquo;ll still be
    plenty full, just not so stuffed. At restaurants, many people ask for a box
    when the food comes out, so they can put some food aside and not have it all
    right in front of them, luring them to eat until they can&rsquo;t possibly
    eat anymore. Again, keep trying to take the 30-60 second pause when you
    notice the small sigh, or feeling of satisfied. If you want to keep eating,
    just try to limit the extent past the pause.
  </span>
</p>
<h2 class="p3">
  <span class="s1">4. Lengthen the pause to several minutes. </span>
</h2>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"
    >Try to relax and take deep breaths. During these few minutes, you may find
    your mindset shifting. The food cools off, your brain is getting some more
    signals that you have eaten. After the few minutes, consider if you want to
    put the food away or keep eating. You might realize you&rsquo;re okay with
    putting it away (and you can always go get it later if you find you need
    it).
  </span>
</p>
<h2 class="p3">
  <span class="s1"
    >5. Plan the next thing you will do after the meal, and go do that thing
    when you notice you are satisfied.
  </span>
</h2>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"
    >This is where you actually practice the big leap: you try and stop when you
    feel satisfied. Reassure yourself that in an hour if you are dying for food
    you can go get some food to eat, but just try. If you find you&rsquo;re
    hitting satisfied while other people are eating and you don&rsquo;t want to
    excuse yourself, you might practice eating more slowly, so you aren&rsquo;t
    finishing and then having to sit at the table for a long time. If you do end
    up with this scenario at home, you can always put your plate in the sink or
    dishwasher and return to the table to chat until the meal is done.
  </span>
</p>
<h2 class="p3">
  <span class="s1"
    >6. Try stopping at satisfied more consistently over time.
  </span>
</h2>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"
    >Allow for mistakes. You might do it once a day for a week, say, just at
    breakfast (which many people find easiest). Then, maybe you try at breakfast
    and lunch for a week. Keep the big picture in mind. And remember all
    practice counts. If you stop at satisfied at one meal and then at the next
    meal you overeat drastically, you still got the rep in of successfully
    practice - and that&rsquo;s building you ability up. Remember to account for
    dessert in your satisfied practice, don&rsquo;t get 100% full on the main
    course if you know you want dessert and eating it will take you into the red
    zone. While you work on this skill you really don&rsquo;t have to make any
    changes to WHAT you are eating, it&rsquo;s all about working with the
    signals from your body to optimize the quantity of food you eat. So if
    you&rsquo;re in the habit of chocolate cream pie for every meal, you can
    just keep on eating chocolate cream pie for every meal while you practice
    stopping at satisfied.

  <span class="s1"
    >I have a few tips for you about this progression, since I&rsquo;ve done it
    with thousands of people.&nbsp;
    <strong
      >Notice the positive benefits all along the way, just like hunger.</strong
    >
    Consider what you are saying YES to and not just on the food you are
    deciding not to have at this moment. Are you saying yes to a healthier body?
    Better sleep, less reflux? Are you saying yes to feeling proud and in
    control? Are you saying yes to a life where you don&rsquo;t have to count
    calories anymore? Stopping at satisfied is a lot more about what you are
    getting, than what you are giving up.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re getting your needs
    met, you&rsquo;re getting satisfied - you&rsquo;re just avoiding the excess.
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"
    ><strong
      >It also incredibly helpful to reduce distractions during meal time, using
      them as Next Things.</strong
    >
    Putting the phone or laptop away until after you eat can help you get better
    at noticing your satisfaction signals because you won&rsquo;t be distracted.
    And if you are looking forward to watching a show or reading a website,
    you&rsquo;ll be happy to do it after the meal, so it can help motivate you
    to stop eating and move onto the thing you want to watch, read or play.
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"
    >I hope you find this progression helpful in your journey to leave binge
    eating behind you and take steps towards your weight loss goals. I love to
    think of this sequence as learning to meet our needs exactly, instead of
    overeating in a binge, then undereating on a diet, then overeating, and
    undereating ... that&rsquo;s just making the same mistake over and over in
    opposite directions. Stopping at satisfied, each meal becomes a repeat of
    hitting the nail on the head. Meeting our needs again and again and again.
    We can save the roller-coasters for amusement parks, right?
