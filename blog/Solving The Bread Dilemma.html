    >And that started my coaching call with Beth, a client who came to me for
    help losing weight and stopping binge eating. We had already completed
    several sessions and talked about her food difficulties, goals, and
    lifestyle but something in her voice told me, &ldquo;This just got real.
    It&rsquo;s honesty time.&rdquo;&nbsp; I love those moments. As a coach,
    it&rsquo;s when I get to begin my most meaningful work.&nbsp;</span

    >Beth continues to tell me how the last few days have been terrible, eating
    wise. She felt drained from work, yet the work kept coming. For the next 3
    months, it wouldn't let up. Instead of sleeping enough, or walking outside
    to deal with the intense pressure, she bought and finished a box of
    crackers. Then cake. Then lots of bread, one slice at a time, until the loaf
    was gone.&nbsp; A Mars bar wrapper on her desk stared at her, reminding her
    of more things she must have eaten but right now can't even remember. She
    knows it is the crackers fault, she assures me. </span

  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >When I gently ask her more about it, she says there's something she can't
    explain. But something bad happens, always involving her, and bread and
    sugar. She tells me the last 3 days are just an example of a long-standing
    pattern, and exactly why she must never ever buy crackers. Or bread. Beth
    doesn't know what exactly the problem is, whether it lies in her mind or
    body, or why other people don't seem to have this inner beast. But she vows
    for the hundredth time to eat no bread, seeing no other option. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Except she adores bread. Some toast with her eggs always seems like it
    belongs. A few crackers to eat with a salad make it satisfying. And sweets
    are just so alluring! Especially when traveling, the airport lounges and
    restaurant buffets seem to offer endless varieties of buns, croissants,
    cookies, and baked goods cooing gentle relief from her jet lag, a soothing
    easy snack to put in her stomach.</span

    >We continue to talk about her life and the role food has played, and it

  <span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >When she is lonely, or stressed, or tired, food helps. Once she makes the
    decision to go find a gelato shop or stop by a convenience store, she knows
    she won&rsquo;t be alone. She looks forward to the crunch, the chewing, the
    salty or sweet flavors, the quiet in her mind of not worrying about the next
    day's meetings or deadlines. During her lowest and most overworked weeks,
    she pushes everyone away. She doesn&rsquo;t have to explain herself that
    way, and no one will judge her. She retreats into her private quiet world,
    with food. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >We talk about the distresses and pain she feels, traveling constantly for
    work, not having a social circle or even a daily routine. I mention how
    normal it is to want comfort and to seek solutions to alleviate our own
    pain. "Nothing is wrong with you", I say several times. &ldquo;That is all
    of us. When we hurt, whether it&rsquo;s a physical injury or psychological
    pain, anything that offers some easing of that pain is going to imprint on
    us. You have been attending to yourself in the most loving way you knew
    how.&rdquo;</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Now she is crying, sniffling, apologizing. There's nothing to be sorry
    about, of course, feelings are a big part of food discussions, so I remind
    her to feel free to feel. I&rsquo;m glad she knows she is safe with me, that
    all the things on her mind are fit to share in this space.</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >We talk about bedtimes and waking times, how consistency and a routine
    would be a welcome predictability in her schedule. We talk about staying
    part of the world instead of ducking out when we feel upset. That our
    tension and frustration can be lightened by just sharing a space with other
    people, even random strangers in a coffee shop. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >She tells me she had thought maybe of going into Starbucks to work, just to
    be around other people. I love this idea. She seems to as well. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >We commit to a bedtime for the coming week and sketch out a plan for the
    groceries in her fridge. Before we wrap up the call, I ask if she had
    breakfast yet, and she said no, what she would love is a bagel at Starbucks. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >And I freeze. Silent. Why did she say that? Is she just going right back to
    the out of control, bread-associated binge eating? "Will you be okay with
    that?" I ask. "I mean, if you're going to eat a bagel and carry on, that's
    perfect. You can focus lunch and dinner on proteins and veggies and be fine.
    But are you going to jump the counter and slap the barista and steal all the
    bagels...." </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">And now she's laughing. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >No, that won't happen, she says calmly. She won't be buying packs of
    chocolates and crackers for home, but one bagel in a public place is not
    going anywhere problematic. She looks calm, relieved, and like talking has
    soothed something deep.</span

    Avoiding bread would never have cured the issue the way we will. Week by
    week, we continue talking about Beth's pain, distress, and comfort. Together
    we're planning out how to stay awake and present in life, even when it's
    hard. We'll practice letting people in and letting stress out through
    movement, self-care, and connection. And since we are handling the real
    problems, we can eat bagels along the way. </span
