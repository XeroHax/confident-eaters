<p>
  Several times a day, I listen to someone describe what and how they eat. One
  of the benefits of having a coach is that someone outside of your head can, in
  many ways, have a clearer view of what&rsquo;s actually going on.
</p>
<p>
  Almost nobody says &ldquo;I need to eat a bigger breakfast&rdquo;. Or even
  &ldquo;I need to eat a bigger lunch&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
  What they do say is, &ldquo;I eat well, but lose it on the weekends.&rdquo;
  Or, &ldquo;I do great all day, and damn it at night I snack, and can&rsquo;t
  stop!&rdquo; The words vary, but it&rsquo;s a very common theme: &ldquo;I eat
  well, until I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  What they see is a problem that starts at 7 pm, or starts on Saturday, or just
  before the kids get home from school...whatever time their particular hot
  button is. And that may well be the case. If we talk about that place and time
  and find there is an emotion, fatigue or stressor that happens at that time of
  day, we&rsquo;re onto something and can work on changing behavior directly. We
  modify thoughts, routines, emotions, and behaviors and soon those extra
  calories are a thing of the past.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >But the problem isn&rsquo;t always originating when it appears to
    be.</strong
  >&nbsp;Sometimes, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s an emotional issue as
  much as a physical one. A lot of midnight snack attacks, afternoon munchies,
  and dinners that end with second portions actually had nothing to do with
  cognitive distortions or emotions, and aren&rsquo;t maladaptive coping
  strategies. These &ldquo;derailments&rdquo; often began as a cascade of events
  that started closer to 8:00&nbsp;<em>AM,</em>&nbsp;at the beginning of the
  day. And that chain of events can continue to gain momentum midday with a
  too-light lunch. I see it all the time.&nbsp;<strong
    >Not eating much in the first 2 meals leads to eating lots later.</strong

<p>
  Research backs this up. Being in a calorie deficit increases brain activity
  related to food, and food captivates your attention more, especially sweets
  and fatty foods (1). That&rsquo;s not a good state to be in when you enter a
  5:00 pm meeting with cookies on the table. You also don&rsquo;t want a brain
  with a heightened sense of food reward when you&rsquo;re going out to dinner
  and spy the breadbasket.
</p>
<p>
  Starting the day well-fed, with a hearty breakfast, and satisfying lunch
  isn&rsquo;t the type of thing that makes people fatter, because it
  doesn&rsquo;t necessarily lead to higher calorie intake overall. Having a high
  protein meal soon after waking up has been shown to be a helpful weight loss
  strategy (2,3). People with excess weight tend to skip or eat very little for
  breakfast and consume most of their calories at night, often in an attempt to
  &ldquo;save calories for later&rdquo;. Skipping breakfast has been linked to
  higher BMI and waist circumference (4).

  Two-fold Risk Of Overweight/Obesity (5)

<p>
  Instead of trying to reduce the damage caused during the &ldquo;witching
  hour&rdquo; by creating a larger calorie deficit at other times of
  day,&nbsp;<em>try the opposite</em>. You could eat more abundantly in the
  first half of the day and discover how differently you feel. Maybe the
  witching hour gets less witchy. Maybe you have an easier time not grabbing
  snacks before bed. Maybe you feel more relaxed, cared-for, and happy as you go
  about your workday. Maybe you feel more energetic and less stress. I
  can&rsquo;t guarantee it, but my clients tell me these things all the time.
</p>
<p>
  Yes, it will take some getting used to if you currently don&rsquo;t make time
  to eat in the morning. It will mean putting in a few minutes, but you&rsquo;ll
  also&nbsp;<em>save</em>&nbsp;those minutes if you don&rsquo;t need to snack in
  the afternoon or evening, so you might be making the time already either way.
  You can eat what you like, there&rsquo;s no magical combination that is
  the&nbsp;<em>only&nbsp;</em>way to have a good breakfast. But if you
  haven&rsquo;t tried it before, I&rsquo;d recommend trying the Big Beautiful
  Breakfast strategy.
</p>
<p>
  Food prep at the beginning of the week can prevent derailing near the tail end
  of the week. And on a smaller time scale, feeding yourself well in the morning
  and midday can set you up to stop struggling in the late afternoon and
  evening.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  I&rsquo;d love to see your Big Beautiful Breakfasts, so if tag me on Facebook
  or Instagram so I can see what you&rsquo;re eating! If you want to focus more
  on getting well-fed midday, lust-worthy lunches might help you hit your goals
  for the evening. The big picture is that if you have a trouble time that
  doesn&rsquo;t seem to be emotionally rooted: you might be struggling
  needlessly because you simply didn&rsquo;t eat enough earlier.
