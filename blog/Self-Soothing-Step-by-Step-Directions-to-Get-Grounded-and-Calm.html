    >Imagine a 7 foot tall, cuddly, furry creature. It can be any color you
    want, but it would probably be a bright candy color. The type who would be
    your special friend if you were a kid in a Pixar or Disney movie. This
    creature is gentle and protective, the type who would wrap you up in a
    comforting hug when the day has been too much and take care of you while you
    nodded off to sleep.
    <strong
      >This creature would say nice things to you when you felt dejected, help
      you rekindle your hope and get back to your feet. They would help you be
      your best self.&nbsp;</strong
    ></span

  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">How awesome would that be? </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >I teach my clients to imagine this creature on the days they really feel
    like they need some comfort. And imagining this big, kind, gentle giant
    speaking to them. What would it say? </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong
      >First, it would listen to you and be keenly interested in how you
      felt.</strong
    >
    It would show concern at your distress, wrinkling its fuzzy brow. It would
    treat you and your feelings as obviously important.&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong
      >It would notice and point out what you had tried hard at and what you did
      well,</strong
    >
    even if the end result was disappointing. It would see the good in
    you.&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong>It would help you reframe the upsetting day.</strong>&nbsp; Your
    fuzzy, lovable giant-pal would remind you that things change, and what
    happened today is trying but won't end the world.&nbsp;He or she&nbsp;might
    help you see how conditions could improve by tomorrow, and that in the big
    picture maybe&nbsp;there is a positive&nbsp;potential outcome.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong>Your special friend would gently encourage you</strong> to keep
    trying, to care for yourself, get some good sleep, nourish yourself, and do
    something small to feel better. Maybe you'd feel better after a shower?
    Maybe you want to nap for a bit, and then start game planning for tomorrow?
    They would encourage you to take action, in a doable, gentle
    step.&nbsp;</span

  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >This furry, lovable, giant creature and his soothing dialog is typically a
    major upgrade from the nasty, critical judge occupying the DJ booth in your
    mind.</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >&nbsp;The one that says <em>your feelings don&rsquo;t matter</em>. That
    voice that thinks
    <em
      >you&rsquo;re weak and silly for being tired; after all, you don&rsquo;t
      have it so hard!</em
    >
    That voice that says
    <em>you might as well quit, because you are a loser and always will be</em

  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Self-soothing from within is the more powerful force to have within you -
    and the cuddly giant creature is the self-soothing role model who will teach
    you how to rescript your inner dialog. With the ability to make yourself
    feel better, anytime, anyplace, you&rsquo;ll always have comfort available.
    You'll be more persistent in pursuing goals (and as you'd expect, achieve
    them more of the time), and you'll bounce back faster after setbacks. You'll
    also spend less time being anxious, depressed, or desperate to find someone
    or something outside yourself to help you feel better. You won't need to
    turn to food, drugs, or distraction. You will be your own rock of support.
    <br /><br />Except unlike a hard, cold rock, your self soothing skills will
    create a cozy, comfortable place within you. So maybe it's most apt to say
    you'll be your own <em>pillow</em> of support.</span

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400">How to Self-Soothe</span></h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Here are the 4 ingredients to a loving, soothing self-dialog, as
    exemplified by our protective creature. We&rsquo;re going to take his or her
    soothing and compassionate, comfort, and wrap it around ourselves like a
    blanket by using the right language. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong>Ingredient 1:</strong>
    <strong>Legitimizing your own feelings.</strong> What do you feel? Be moved
    by your own suffering. You&rsquo;ve been through something or are going
    through something. Let yourself notice your emotions and treat them like
    they matter.&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong>Ingredient 2: Giving yourself credit.</strong> What did you do well
    or put in an honest effort at? Sometimes we only remember the mistakes we
    made, or we dismiss our efforts because the outcome wasn&rsquo;t what we had
    wanted. But we can&rsquo;t control how things end up, and if we did our
    best, that&rsquo;s worth recognizing and praise, because it is what we want
    to do in the future.&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong>Ingredient 3: Reappraising your situation.</strong> Reassure
    yourself. Maybe things aren&rsquo;t so terrible, will improve with time, or
    have a hidden positive aspect? Even pain and suffering can have positive
    outcomes on our mental skills, relationships, and life course.&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong>Ingredient 4: Gently encouraging.</strong> Once you have listened
    and legitimized your feelings, given yourself some credit, and done your
    best to see the situation in a less-upsetting light, the final step is
    gently encouraging yourself. You don&rsquo;t want to quit. You might need a
    rest, but you don&rsquo;t want to stay on the couch forever. You might need
    encouragement to try again tomorrow, or to ask for help from an expert, or
    try a new approach to a stubborn problem. If you made a mistake, you can
    gently encourage yourself to learn from it, forgive, and keep moving
    forward.

<h2>What self soothing is, and is not</h2>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Self-soothing is helping yourself feel better, de-escalating painful
    feelings and improving your mood when it's in a negative state. It's 100%
    good for you. It feels good and has positive outcomes.&nbsp;<br /><br />Self-soothing
    is NOT shedding all responsibility, coddling ourselves into inaction, or
    navel-gazing and wallowing in self-pity. None of those would help you become
    your best self. The nasty judge in your mind might not want to be replaced,
    so he might say that this self-soothing technique is a terrible idea. That
    it will make you lazy and soft and weak and you'll never reach your goals
    unless you stay mean to yourself and suffer immense pain.
    <em>That's how you learn</em>, the mean critic will say.
    <em
      >Being&nbsp;unhappy and in pain is what will motivate you.&nbsp;<br /></em
    ><br />He's lying. No one flourishes from criticism.<br /><br />If&nbsp;self-criticism&nbsp;hasn't
    led you to achieving your goals, I'd highly recommend taking the
    self-soothing dialog for test drive. If you don't like it, you can always go
    back. My clients use this formula out loud, in their minds, and they use the
    four points as a starting place for journal entries. If you have ever
    thought "I should journal right now, but I don't know what to write..." Jot
    these 4 prompts in your notebook:&nbsp;<br /><br />1. What do you feel? What
    have you been through today?</span
  >
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><br />2. Despite what may have gone wrong, what did you do well? Did you
    put forth some effort that you can feel proud of?&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><br />3. How might&nbsp;the upsetting events from today have even a small
    positive outcome or result? Might things improve in the coming days or
    weeks?&nbsp;<br
