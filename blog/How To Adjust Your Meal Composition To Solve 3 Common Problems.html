  Using your body's cues to guide your eating is reliable and more effective for
  losing fat than counting calories or avoiding carbohydrates. But it is not
  easy. "Eat when you're hungry and stop when you're satisfied" is one piece of
  weight loss advice that is, while technically true, more irritating than it is
  helpful. That's because it's a gross oversimplification.

  If you were seeking instruction on how to change your car's oil and someone
  said "take out the old oil, and put in clean oil", you probably (and
  justifiably) wouldn't feel very... helped.
</p>
<p>
  To successfully change the oil in your car, you'd need specific action steps
  laid out clearly and explained. Managing to eat well is arguably more complex
  than changing the oil in your car, which is why we actually teach our clients
  how to do each skill.

  In this article, I'll share some information on how you can adjust your meals
  in terms of composition to achieve greater satiation and satiety. These terms
  actually are two different things, satiation meaning you feel full enough to
  put down the fork and conclude your meal, and satiety being the length of time
  between meals, or in other words, how long hunger stays out of your way for.
</p>
<p>
  Before we get into that though, it's important to establish some background
  info. This advice to optimize macronutrients assumes you are already eating
  3-4 meals without snacking and also that you are eating mostly whole foods. If
  you are grazing throughout the day, check out that lesson (in our library)
  before worrying about macronutrients. If you currently are eating mostly
  convenience foods like frozen meals and fast food, you also can get more
  returns on your efforts from starting elsewhere, so begin with the skill of
  choosing mostly whole foods.

    >I am full when I stop eating, but in 30-60 minutes I feel like I didn't eat
    enough. What should I change?</strong

</p>
<p>
  Most often this happens when people are loading up on veggies and not enough
  other stuff, like protein, fat, and starch. Is your plate more than half
  veggies? If so, and you feel like the description above, you are probably
  setting off your rapid satiation signals from stretch receptors in your
  stomach, which triggers immediate fullness, but that feeling won't last long
  if it's not followed up by signals that you've eaten enough carbohydrates,
  proteins, and fats. Rather than try to pack in more grains and chicken and oil
  on top of a full belly of vegetables, ease off on the veggie portions a bit so
  you have room for the other stuff too. Bottom line: increase calorie density
  so you get lasting satiety without busting your stomach.

  <strong
    >I eat until satisfied, and feel satisfied for a few hours but keep getting
    hungry too early to make it four or six hours until my next meal. What
    should I change?</strong

<p>
  You don't have to eat until you're overfull, you're doing a great thing
  practicing stopping at satisfied. If you aren't feeling satisfied for long
  enough, step one is to check if your meals are solid or liquid. Liquids empty
  from the stomach faster than solids, so if you're drinking smoothies or soups
  for your meal, try adding a solid component (like a piece of toast with
  cheese) instead of something you were blending into the smoothie.
</p>
<p>
  If you are eating solid food, step two is to check up on how much fat is in
  your meal. If it's typically under ten grams, then you definitely could
  benefit from more. If it's around 15 or 20 grams, you still might find it
  helpful to experiment with adding some more fat to see if it helps you get an
  extra hour or two before hunger shows up. Check out our free course on how to
  optimize your intake of fat.

<h3>Problem Presentation 3:</h3>
<p>
  <strong
    >I feel insatiable (thanks to PMS or increased workouts or activity). Like I
    can't get full?! What can I do?</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  It can be scary to feel like a bottomless pit if you are weight conscious; on
  one hand, you don't want to inhale 1500 calories in a single sitting, but on
  the other, it feels impossible to stop eating when you are not satisfied.
  Relax, take a deep breath, you will get full. You don&rsquo;t want to speed
  eat or you&rsquo;ll end up with a bellyache and likely get overfull.
</p>
<p>
  First, the king and queen of immediate satisfaction are volume and protein. So
  you'll want to play those cards big-time when your appetite feels out of
  control. For volume, go big with your servings of veggies. Have a plate of
  green beans or mashed cauliflower if you like them. Liquids help too, so fizzy
  water, tea, coffee or soup can all help trigger impulses along the nerve from
  your stomach stretch receptors to your brain, saying 'Heyo, we're full!'
</p>
<p>
  Protein also helps, so find some chicken, Greek yogurt, lunch meat, or eggs
  and put them in your pie hole asap. Especially if you're choosing lean
  protein, don't worry if you want to increase your usual portion. Extra protein
  is highly satiating calorie for calorie, so load up on that. Eat an extra
  chicken breast, it's ok. (For more on how eating protein will help boost your
  weight loss, check out the Protein course.)
</p>
<p>
  What to avoid is equally worth mentioning in this case. Steer clear of going
  first to fat-rich foods when you are extra ravenous, because fat is the
  slowest macronutrient to trigger satisfaction feelings. Nuts are wonderful
  foods, but some of the worst choices to grab when you want to be satisfied as
  soon as possible! They are small in volume, so put little pressure on the
  stomach walls, and in the 20-30 minutes it takes to start to break down the
  fat and transmit the chemical signals up to your brain... Well, we can eat a
  lot of nuts, easily 600-800 calories! Save the nuts and peanut butter for
  garnishing or topping, not for eating by the handful/spoonful in a ravenous
  moment.

<h3>3 Take Home Points:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    If you feel full but then realize soon after you&rsquo;re not satisfied
    enough, ease off of the veggies and add some more calorie density with fat,
    protein or starch.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you need more satiation (to help put down the fork), up your high volume
    foods (veggies and fruit) and protein.
  </li>
  <li>If you need more lasting satiety, add some more fat to your meals.</li>
</ol>
