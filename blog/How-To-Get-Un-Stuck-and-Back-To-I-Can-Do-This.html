  Thank you for sharing&nbsp;how you are feeling. You are asking for help, and
  that is awesome.&nbsp;<strong
    >You have done the next positive thing you could think to do, which was to
    reach out for support.</strong
  >&nbsp;Give yourself credit for that. Woo! That is step one. We all feel
  sometimes like we are really stuck, like we can't. It's just a feeling, it
  will come and go. It doesn't mean you actually can't do something&nbsp;<em
    >just because you feel like you can't.&nbsp;</em

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Second, remember you are a person, not a robot.</strong>&nbsp;That is
  okay and normal and we like that here. Be flail-y, be lost, be whatever you
  need to be in this moment. We are all right here for you, we&rsquo;ve been
  where you are, we will be again, and this is why we all have each other. Okay?
  No worries, we&rsquo;ll just take this one step at a time, together.
  Struggling and trying but not succeeding at certain points&nbsp;IS part of the
  process, not a sign of anything being wrong. The fact that&nbsp;you
  haven&rsquo;t succeeded yet in figuring this part out, just means you
  haven&rsquo;t succeeded yet. That&rsquo;s the case with everything we
  haven&rsquo;t solved&hellip; yet. Every problem is unsolved, until it&rsquo;s
  solved.&nbsp;The past doesn't define the future.&nbsp;

<p>
  <strong
    >Third, give yourself some space to breathe and think in a loving, safe
    atmosphere.</strong
  >&nbsp;The thing I want to do most is sit you down as a friend (let&rsquo;s
  pretend we are in a lovely park and sitting on a bench and we are having green
  tea smoothies or something equally trendy) and ask if there is something you
  want to talk about? Some stress&nbsp;at work or home that has you feeling
  lost, inadequate, like you are struggling to find a direction or a center of
  some sort? Or something that used to be at work but isn&rsquo;t there anymore
  and so the void is being filled with food? Anything like that, no matter how
  small it seems. Lay it on me, sister. I&rsquo;m right here. *sips her smoothie
  and watches some ducks in a nearby pond while you think on things*

<p>
  In your own time,&nbsp;where the habits are concerned, give a thought to the
  following three options:
</p>
<p>
  4)&nbsp;<strong
    >Consider doing&nbsp;a mind-body scan&nbsp;right when you feel the urge to
    stray from the intention you had (or when are doing the behavior you feel
    like you &ldquo;can&rsquo;t&rdquo; stop).&nbsp;</strong
  >&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t necessarily have to stop yourself, but just taking
  stock of your state&nbsp;<em>in that moment</em>&nbsp;can help you understand
  what is going on in your mind that is translating to your body in this
  situation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  5)&nbsp;<strong
    >Remind yourself (out loud if you&rsquo;re up for it!) that you don't have
    to&nbsp;do anything you don&rsquo;t want to do.</strong
  >&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t even have to do the habits! If&nbsp;the habits have
  become a&nbsp;rule&nbsp;rather than a choice, they have become about
  restriction instead of freedom. So, aside from some possible outside emotional
  influences, what is really going on here may a simple&nbsp;rebellion. This
  happens a lot to people.&nbsp;<strong
    >The habits are meant to bring you freedom, simplicity, happiness, and
    comfort, not stress, pain, and misery.</strong
  >&nbsp;If that is happening, then there is something not right, and we look at
  how to fix it, okay? No big deal.
</p>
<p>
  If you don&rsquo;t want to do this anymore, you can stop.&nbsp;Make sure you
  still want to change, and if you do, let&rsquo;s look at Step 6.
</p>
<p>
  6) When you feel like you &ldquo;can&rsquo;t&rdquo;, that is an
  indication&nbsp;that the habit needs to be
  &ldquo;Goldilocksed&rdquo;.&nbsp;<strong
    >Customize the change you are trying to make; it&nbsp;needs to fit you
    better.&nbsp;</strong
  >When you feel like you can do it, and you&rsquo;re highly confident you are
  up to it, that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;just right&rdquo; habit version for you. If
  you are learning that three meals a day doesn&rsquo;t work for you, you could
  try four instead. Lots of people do four a day.&nbsp;Or you could start with
  not snacking between breakfast and lunch. Or you could start with not snacking
  for one hour after lunch. You are worth finding a good fit.

    >Blisters are a sign your shoes don&rsquo;t fit.&nbsp;Feeling like&nbsp;<em
      >you can&rsquo;t possibly do this</em
    >&nbsp;is a sign your habit doesn&rsquo;t fit.&nbsp;</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  Neither is a sign of anything being wrong with you.<br /><br />Here's a
  graphic you can save or print to help remind you what to do next time the
  stuck feeling hits.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img
