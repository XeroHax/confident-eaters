<h1><span style="font-weight: 400">Dietary Quality&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Higher scores for depression and anxiety are associated with a cluster of
    unhealthy lifestyle factors, including smoking, physical inactivity and poor
    diet (2). While many people are looking to add expensive &ldquo;functional
    foods&rdquo;, &ldquo;superfoods&rdquo; or dietary supplements to their daily
    habits in order to improve mental health, the strongest evidence for
    efficacy calls for addressing the foundations first and foremost: making
    better selections of food at daily meals and staying physically
    active.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span

  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >How is a &ldquo;high quality diet&rdquo; defined? What aspects can a

</h2>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Choosing mostly unprocessed foods is one concept that can guide behavior,
    and is applicable to international audiences while still accommodating
    regional preferences and tradition (3). A study of pregnant women found that
    consuming a typical Brazilian diet (predominantly rice, beans and tea) or a
    healthy diet was associated with lower anxiety scores compared to a
    processed diet (4). A traditional diet characterized by vegetables, fruit,
    meat, fish, and whole grains has been linked to better mental health
    outcomes than a &ldquo;Western&rdquo; diet high in processed or fried foods,
    refined grains, sugary products, and beer (5). Five consecutive nationwide
    studies of Canadians have correlated a lower fruit and vegetable intake with
    anxiety and other mental health disorders (6). </span

  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >A 2017 analysis reports that diets which are more inflammatory (high in
    fat, sugar, processed and red meats, refined grains and alcohol) increase a
    person&rsquo;s risk for anxiety by 60%, compared to diets with the lowest
    inflammatory scores (7). Consistent with this, Tayefi et al. report that
    subjects with severe anxiety also had high levels of circulating C reactive
    protein (hsCRP), a marker of inflammation (8). Another analysis found the
    increased risk of anxiety from consuming a diet high in processed and
    unhealthy foods was 27% and 29%, in Norwegian men and women, respectively
    (9). Consistent findings have been reported with Iranian adults (10).</span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >One tool commonly used to assess diet quality is the Alternative Healthy
    Eating Index (AHEI 2010). Higher scores on AHEI-2010 were shown to be
    associated with lowered prevalence of anxiety in Iranian adults, with
    greatest effects in women and those older than 40 (11). Higher AHEI scores
    have also been shown to be associated with lower anxiety in military
    personnel (12).&nbsp;</span

</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Randomized controlled interventions are necessary to determine causality,
    and more than a dozen studies have been conducted to see if improving diet
    quality could cause improvements in mental health. Of ten interventions
    which reported anxiety score outcomes, just 2 produced significant
    improvements due to the diet intervention. The remaining 8 trials did not
    achieve a statistically significant positive effect but none of the trials
    found the diet intervention to worsen symptoms. Common themes among these
    interventions were increasing intake of fruits, vegetables, fiber, and
    seafood (13).&nbsp;</span

</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >The bottom line: Evidence supports increasing fruits, vegetables, seafood,
    and whole grains eaten, as well as decreasing added sugars, fried foods,
    packaged foods, white flour and alcohol. Processed red meats (hot dogs,
    salami, bacon) should be minimized, but evidence is equivocal on unprocessed
    red meats such as fresh steak, pork, and ground beef, and the influence of
    poultry does not appear to be significant. </strong

</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Measures of dietary diversity are lower in women with higher anxiety
    ratings (14 Poorrezaeian 2015). It is important to maintain a diverse diet
    and consume a variety of foods to obtain all the necessary nutrients, and if
    anxiety-driven food restrictions go unchecked, malnutrition and/or
    orthorexia can develop.&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >It is possible that anxiety causes people to eat the same familiar foods on
    a regular basis, or limited diet diversity may encourages the development of
    anxiety. A less diverse diet leads to reduced bacterial diversity in the
    gut, increased intestinal permeability and chronic inflammation, all of
    which have been implicated in the development of mental health disorders
    (15).&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Food selection itself can be such a cause of anxiety, and restriction of
    food one way to cope with high anxiety levels. Today&rsquo;s society
    encourages personal responsibility with regard to diet and health, yet
    nutrition messages inundating consumers are often inconsistent, misleading
    or incomplete. Focus groups have revealed that simply choosing what to eat
    is a significant source of confusion and anxiety (16).</span

</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Nutrition professionals can help our clients and patients by encouraging
    and demonstrating that all foods fit into a healthy diet, and choosing not
    to demonize or vilify food groups. Utilizing counseling strategies that are
    based on flexible dietary restraint as opposed to rigid restraint yields
    better long term outcomes in terms of mental health and weight loss.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >The bottom line: Anxiety can lead to a reduction in diet diversity, and a
    limited diet can contribute to worsened anxiety. Professionals can assist by
    recommending and modeling inclusion of a wide variety of foods. It is not
    advisable to swear off certain items or forbid any food groups
    entirely.&nbsp;</strong

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400">Impact of High Fat Diet&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >High fat diets containing 45% and 58% kcal from fat cause anxiety-like
    symptoms and heightened sensitivity to stressors in rats (17,18). This
    effect is also seen in non human primates consuming a less extreme high fat
    diet with 37% of calories from fat (19). This increased anxiety-like
    behavior has been attributed to changes in how the brain produces,
    distributes, and responds to the neurotransmitter serotonin. In fact, there
    is some evidence indicating that antidepressant drugs which work via
    serotonin may have less efficacy when a high fat diet (45% calories from
    fat) is consumed (20). Dutheil et al. highlighted other brain changes that
    accompany high fat (60% of calories) diet-induced anxiety, including
    inflammation, disturbed glucose regulation, and elevated corticosterone
    (21). Fortunately, discontinuing the high fat diet reduced the anxiety and
    reversed many of the pathway disturbances. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >It is important to note that the abundance of animal data on high fat diets
    and behavior is limited by the lack of a perfect model (mice don&rsquo;t get
    generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety or have panic attacks). These
    data may also be confounded by a calorie surplus or obesity, since the
    animals consuming high fat diets are virtually always also consuming a great
    deal more calories than the control group. However, animal studies have
    shown that consuming a diet with 60% calories from diet caused gut biome
    changes that led to neurologic dysfunction even in the absence of weight
    gain (22).&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >High fat diets have also been linked to the development of anxiety in
    humans, especially in a hypercaloric state which produces obesity,
    inflammation and type 2 diabetes (23). High fat diets cause changes in gut
    bacteria which promote inflammation, increased gut lining permeability
    (&ldquo;leaky gut&rdquo;), and adversely affect mood and cognitive function
    (15).&nbsp; When calories are limited, such as on a weight loss diet, it is
    possible that a higher level of fat in the diet may not have such negative
    consequences (24). However in free living humans, higher fat intakes
    correlate with higher calorie intakes and predispose towards gaining body
    weight, so a moderate fat diet would be preferable for mental
    health.&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >Bottom line: Evidence supports moderating fat to help avoid negative
    impacts on brain function and mental health. High fat intake such as
    prescribed by ketogenic or low carbohydrate dieting may interfere with
    mental function and mood, increasing anxiety susceptibility.</strong

</p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400">Influence of Bodyweight</span></h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >There is evidence that obesity favors the development of anxiety disorders
    (23). While on the surface this may appear as an unequivocal reason to lose
    excess weight, it presents a chicken-or-the-egg scenario, since it&rsquo;s
    entirely possible that anxiety disorders cause weight gain, and not the
    other way around. Women with higher anxiety have been shown to consume more
    calories and fat, have a higher BMI and altered processing in the brain of
    high calorie food images (25). It&rsquo;s unknown to what degree this
    altered brain processing may make weight loss harder. Would it be more
    feasible to reduce anxiety in order to lose weight, or would losing weight
    unlock the key to alleviating a patient&rsquo;s anxiety? We simply
    don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  Does losing weight improve anxiety among overweight or obese men and women? It
  might, but it&rsquo;s not a guarantee. In a review of seven interventional
  studies, three found that anxiety improved with weight loss and four
  interventions found no change in anxiety level (26)
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >The relationship between body weight and anxiety is more complex than
    &ldquo;one causes the other&rdquo;, in part because anxiety can make an
    individual eat more or less (27). Additionally, our society presents
    differential stressors on people of different body weights. An
    individual&rsquo;s feelings of anxiety can be impacted by weight stigma and
    sexual harassment, variables which also may shift as they gain or lose
    weight. As such, a person who develops anxiety and gains weight as a result
    may encounter discrimination and trauma that further increase their mental
    health struggles in a feedforward direction.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Attachment anxiety in particular, characterized by feeling insecure about
    close relationships, is linked to binge eating (28). Anxiety has also been
    shown to be correlated with emotional eating, another known contributor to
    weight gain (29).&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >Bottom line: For overweight or obese individuals, reducing body weight is
    more likely to improve anxiety than worsen it. For those experiencing weight
    related stigma, feelings of insecurity about relationships, binge eating or
    emotional eating, seeking treatment for anxiety may be a considerable help
    in not only feeling better, but attaining weight loss goals.&nbsp;</strong

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400">Bisphenol A (BPA) Exposure&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Animal studies have demonstrated health and behavior problems as a result
    of exposure to bisphenol A, a compound found in many plastics. BPA increases
    anxiety-like behavior in mice, rats and prairie voles (30, 31,
    32).&nbsp;</span

</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >BPA exposure causes most harm during development, so the risks are highest
    for in utero exposure to fetuses and consumption by young children. Health
    and behavior consequences may not be immediate but can appear later in life.
    Because giving this chemical to humans for the sake of experiments poses an
    obvious ethical dilemma, our evidence in humans is limited to
    observations.&nbsp;</span

</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >A study on young children found that higher levels of urinary BPA were
    associated with worsened anxiety, but only in boys (33). Another research
    team found differential behavior effects of prenatal BPA exposure on boys
    and girls, with boys showing worsened anxiety at 3-5 and 10-12 years of age.
    (34, 35). These findings are consistent with animal studies indicating that
    changes in neural development influenced by BPA can be lasting.</span

</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Removal of BPA has been a priority in the plastics industry, and its use
    has been outlawed in baby bottles by the FDA. However the replacement of BPA
    with other compounds has not necessarily been as successful as intended from
    a health standpoint. Bisphenol F, one such substitute, has been reported in
    a 2017 publication to cause worse anxiety-like behavior alterations in mice
    than BPA (36).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span

</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >Bottom line: As an adult, if BPA or other endocrine disruptors have
    contributed to your anxiety, sadly the majority of damage is likely already
    done. However you can reduce exposure to your offspring and impact future
    generations by using glass, stainless steel or ceramic products instead of

    other mental health disorders (37).&nbsp; Many studies have shown an
    association between low levels of serum omega 3 fats or elevated omega-6
    fatty acids to worse depression symptoms. However, fewer human studies have
    been done looking at anxiety specifically, and evidence is mixed (38).</span

<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Observational study has revealed that people who consume the most DHA, one
    specific omega-3 fat, have been found to have up to a 50% reduced risk for
    anxiety disorders (39). The amount of serum DHA has also been shown to be
    inversely associated with anxiety disorders in pregnant women (40). Women
    with the lowest DHA levels were nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with
    an anxiety disorder as women with higher levels. A study of older adults
    also found that higher levels of omega-3 fats in the blood were correlated
    with lower levels of depression and anxiety (41)</span

</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >A randomized controlled trial conducted with medical students found that
    omega-3 supplementation (2.5 g/d, 2085 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 348 mg
    docosahexaenoic acid for 12 weeks) reduced anxiety significantly compared to
    a control supplement with fatty acids reflective of the standard American
    diet. (42). Other reports however, have found that low blood levels of omega
    3 fatty acids correlated with depression, but not with anxiety (43). In a
    clinical trial, consuming salmon 3 times a week was effective in reducing
    self-reported anxiety. (44)</span
  ><strong><br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >The Bottom Line: Evidence supports consuming omega-3 rich oils from fish or
    supplements to help reduce anxiety. Three servings of fish a week or 2.5
    grams of omega-3 oil from supplements is an effective dose.&nbsp;</strong

</p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400">Trans Fat&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >There is abundance of data indicating that animals consuming trans fat
    display increased anxiety-like behaviors across the lifespan (45, 46, 47).
    In humans, trans fatty acids and their food source hydrogenated oils have
    been shown to correlate with increased anxiety in both young and old people
    (41, 48).&nbsp; A 2016 report linked trans fat intake with negative
    emotional affect, though they did not specifically assess anxiety (49). It
    was also found in the same study that adults with higher trans fat intakes
    struggled more with emotional regulation, having greater difficulty with
    emotional awareness, emotional clarity, and using strategies to manage their
    emotions (50). Even if these endpoints do not coincide exactly with anxiety,
    they are skills a person needs to recover or manage an anxiety disorder, and
    thus are pertinent considerations.&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >The bottom line: Trans fat negatively impacts brain function. Evidence
    supports avoiding hydrogenated oils and the trans fats they contain as much
    as possible. Avoiding trans fat consumption may support a more positive
    baseline mood, as well as full capability to sense and respond strategically
    to the negative emotions which do arise.&nbsp;</strong

    correlated with anxiety, and for each unit of vitamin D increase the risk of
    anxiety fell by 3.33% (48). In pregnant women, similar data has been
    reported, where lower levels of vitamin D were associated with higher scores
    on anxiety inventory tests, however these effects were not large enough to
    be statistically significant when other factors were statistically adjusted
    for (51).&nbsp;</span

    ><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >In healthy young Australian adults, supplementing vitamin D at the level of

    serotonin, which is synthesized from tryptophan. Tryptophan depletion
    occurring naturally or experimentally can induce anxiety. In late pregnancy,
    blood levels of tryptophan fall until several days after birth, a phenomenon

    after consuming this drink compared to a placebo beverage. In studies of
    healthy young men and anxiety patients, this increased feeling of
    anxiousness and precipitated panic attacks when given a CO2 challenge (55,

    lots of people might identify with: going on a low carb crash diet before
    vacation can make anxiety symptoms much worse (64). In a 2006 paper
    published in the journal Psychosomatics, Ehrenrich documents the case of a
    female patient who had previously been successfully treated for panic
    attacks and anxiety symptoms, but whose symptoms re-emerged after beginning
    a low carb diet (the Atkins Diet) which restricted total carbohydrate to 20
    grams per day.&nbsp;</span

  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Attempting any restrictive diet can act as an anxiety trigger, and it may
    not be the reduction in carbohydrates per se that caused this individuals
    mental health to decline. Halyburton found no significant mood changes
    between subjects consuming 4% as carbohydrate; and subjects consuming a 46%
    of total energy as carbohydrate as part of a weight loss trial (65).

    trials of probiotics which measured anxiety and or stress (67). Of these,
    five found positive results, though the strains of probiotic, dosing, and
    length of intervention all varied. Treatments which were reported to reduce
    anxiety measures included L. casei (24 billion CFU daily x 2 months), a
    combination of L. helveticus and B. longum (3 billion CFU daily x 30 days)
    and a higher self-reported intake of fermented foods (68, 69, 70). A 2017
    paper reported that probiotic supplement Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (6
    billion CFU per day) decreased anxiety among women during pregnancy and the
    first 6 months post-partum (71).</span

    >The bottom line: The connection between the gut microbiota and mood is a
    rapidly evolving field of research. Consuming a wide variety of complex
    carbohydrates and fibers helps develop a varied gut biome and is
    recommended. It is too early to tell which supplement strains and doses may
    be helpful for anxiety, however evidence is mounting for bifidobacterium and
    lactobacillus strains.&nbsp;</span

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400">Micronutrients</span></h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Deficiency of magnesium, iron, or calcium produces anxiety-like behaviors
    in mice, and replenishing these minerals alleviates the behavioral symptoms
    (72). However, Jacka et al. report finding no relation between intake of
    magnesium, folate and zinc and anxiety in humans (73). A double-blind,
    randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted in 2014-2015 also found no
    effect of zinc or magnesium supplementation on anxiety symptoms in
    postpartum women (74). However, a 2013 meta-analysis of
    multivitamin/multimineral supplementation indicates that they may reduce
    anxiety and mild psychological symptoms in a general population (75).
    Because the formulations used have included many nutrients in varying
    levels, and because individual&rsquo;s diets also vary, the optimal amounts
    of each nutrient which might be included in a multivitamin/multimineral
    supplement are unknown. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong
    >The bottom line: Do your best to eat an adequate diet and attain a full
    spectrum of vitamins and minerals from food. Multivitamins are an option to
    help ensure adequate intake of micronutrients when diet quality is
    suboptimal.&nbsp;</strong
  >
</p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400">Vegetarianism</span></h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Vegetarians show higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders, however
    it has been shown that the onset of these disorders typically precedes
    adoption of a vegetarian diet (76).</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  A vegan diet was tested in large workplace intervention and significantly
  improved anxiety, other markers of mental health, and productivity (77). While
  the study was randomized and controlled, because the subjects could not be
  blinded (they knew if they were in the vegan or control groups) it is possible
  these results are biased by the subjects&rsquo; perceptions.&nbsp;<span
    style="font-weight: 400"
    ><br
  /></span>
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >The bottom line: There is not enough evidence to either recommend or
    discourage vegetarianism for anxiety management.&nbsp;</strong
