    lunch, manage to spill yogurt on your crotch. While you try to wash it off
    in the bathroom, making awkwardly intimate moves with the porcelain sink,
    your phone rings. And your kid needs to be picked up from school, because

    >Maybe the details in your life differ, and life&rsquo;s cruelty shows up
    instead as a sick dog, migraine, and broken eyeglasses. The details
    don&rsquo;t matter, because some things remain the same. When we&rsquo;re
    having one of those days, we are more likely to eat too much, cave to a
    craving rather than sit through it, stress ourselves out, and not get done
    all the things we wanted to. If you&rsquo;re like most people, these days
    can dampen your mood and make you feel frustrated and down.&nbsp;</span

    still not perfect, but you ate an apple out of your lunch, and stopped by
    Subway on the way home. Sure, maybe you got a cookie with your sandwich, but
    how much of an improvement is that in the big picture? A lot.</span

<h2>Things which fire up intense emotions for us show us our values.</h2>
<p>
  This goes for the highest highs and the lowest lows.&nbsp;<span
    style="font-weight: 400"
    >Think of the most epically wonderful events or moments in your life. From
    them, you can tell what is really meaningful for you. Do those memories
    include your family, or were you celebrating pushing yourself through a
    challenge? The same goes for the really devastating or angering memories.
    The times our jaws dropped open in disbelief, or we felt so angered that we
    couldn&rsquo;t bear to sit by and let it happen, we needed to stand up and
    DO something! Those memories, as painful as they are, also show you in the
    truest sense who you really are. The things that hurt you show you what your
    values are.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s not just fun facts or navel gazing:
    it&rsquo;s crucial information. Knowing what we value is important in
    steering our life choices, because what other people value or want
    isn&rsquo;t important. It&rsquo;s just a distraction.&nbsp;</span

    &ldquo;friends&rdquo; than you had yesterday. But when you lost your job,
    your cat was diagnosed with cancer, or you needed a ride to the airport at 5
    am, who are your friends then? The people that stuck around and cheered for
    you when you were behind by 21 points are your real friends. </span

    I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s a good thing, BUT it does happen to
    everyone. And the value in it? People who are kind and gracious and
    understanding when you aren&rsquo;t your best self really love you. (And
    they&rsquo;ll accept your apology).&nbsp;</span

<h2>You grow stronger.</h2>
<p>
  The skills to get through life&rsquo;s problems with composure tend to come
  from things which are much tougher than we would have elected for ourselves. I
  know people who seem to have developed infinite patience and strength - and I
  know they got those attributes through circumstances I wouldn&rsquo;t wish on
  anyone. Whatever trauma or misfortune may have dropped in your lap, it can be
  part of building your self confidence. You will have self-esteem rooted in
  knowing you have been through adversity and survived. You don&rsquo;t have to
  live in fear of &ldquo;what if&rdquo; because you know you will handle it when
  it comes.
</p>
<h2>
  If you&rsquo;re not skilled at accepting help from other people, outstandingly
  bad days and overwhelmingly awful circumstances will bring it to your
  attention.
</h2>
<p>
  And that can be ouchy. However it's also extremely valuable if you want to
  better yourself. You ask and accept help, or you suffer. I have learned this
  myself (more than once, as is typical) when my &ldquo;do everything on my
  own&rdquo; modus operandi wasn't possible. When I was post-surgery or
  bedridden with pain, and just plain couldn&rsquo;t do things like get the mail
  or do the laundry, my limitation to accept help became really obvious. When I
  needed paramedics to rescue my hypothermic shivering butt from the woods last
  year, I was in therapy for weeks afterward to overcome the guilt I felt at
  having taken their time due to my own mistakes. It&rsquo;s definitely an area
  of my weakness, but as a skilled counselor helped me see, it was me not
  feeling worthy of love that made it so difficult. And that has helped me to
  accept aid&nbsp;and kindness from other people with less resistance.&nbsp;

  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Allowing other people to love us means letting them make dinner, do the
    laundry, or take out the dog.&nbsp; It means letting them listen to you for
    an hour when you bawl or blabber on about yourself in a completely one-sided
    conversation. If you want to be fully part of the world, part of the human
    collective, let people offer you a hand, a handout, or a favor you
    can&rsquo;t repay. That&rsquo;s how you let people love you.&nbsp;</span

  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Military veterans are bonded for life. They stay in touch for decades and
    across thousands of miles, as close as brothers. Part of this is because
    they suffered together in service. Think of the people you feel close to,
    and how they have confided in you when they were upset or faced a dilemma.
    That strengthened your friendship. Telling someone else about your own
    struggles, even if those struggles are in the past, helps them feel
    understood and not alone. These rough moments in our lives connect us in a
    way idyllic living never would.&nbsp;</span

<h2>The sun comes out again.&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
  The darkest, longest, coldest nights of your life still led to a sunrise.
  Sometimes, the sun is rising on a world that is forever changed and different.
  Things don&rsquo;t necessarily get fixed, but we do find that if we hang in
  there, letting a few hours or days pass often lightens the view, eases the
  pain, and reminds us that life ain&rsquo;t over yet.&nbsp;
