    >You sit down with what feels like a great meal. You thought about making it

    >I help clients iron out this post-meal grazing frustration all the time, so

    steps you can take to help avoid unnecessary grazing after the meal.</span

</p>
<h1>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Possibility #1: Your meals are too small for your body and energy
    needs</span
  >
</h1>
<p>
  I made this mistake for years, as do many people trying to achieve a calorie
  deficit. Trying to stop before you're satisfied however, can lead to a tug of
  war where you want more food but are resisting because you want to minimize
  calorie intake. Instead of aiming to eating as little as possible, think about
  getting comfortable and stopping there. Include all the major macronutrients
  (protein, fats, and carbohydrates) for the best satisfaction response. Putting
  enough food on your plate to begin with may be the key step for you to feel
  satisfied and done when you finish eating at the table, and not cruising the
  cabinets after the meal is over looking for something else.&nbsp;
</p>
<h1>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Possibility #2: You're eating too quickly.
  </span>
</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >You've heard that it can take 20 minutes or more for the food you've eaten
    to be fully sensed by your brain. It's true, plus if your food is gone in
    moments you miss out on the enjoyable, relaxing process of enjoying it. Give
    yourself more time to eat and try not to hurry through cleaning your plate.
    You might find that taking 5 minutes longer to finish your plate makes the
    difference between it feeling like it's enough versus needing an
    addition.&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<h1>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Possibility #3: You are still hunting for pleasure</span
  >
</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
    It makes sense to want to linger in pleasant environments and extend the
    activities in our lives which feel good. After all, many of us spend so much
    time working or doing non-fun things that meal times can become one of few
    precious opportunities to have a window of time to just relax and enjoy
    something. If you find yourself in this situation, there are two things I
    recommend (in addition to slowing down as highlighted in #2,
    above.)&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong
      >First, speaking generally, don't shortchange yourself on joy in your day
      to day life.</strong
    >
    If you feel guilty over taking time for yourself or doing something purely
    for enjoyment, then you're likely to do it infrequently, and not embrace it
    fully when you do. Joy is an important part of a balanced life! Many of my
    clients have needed to dial up the joy in their lives to find more balanced
    feelings about eating. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong
      >Secondly and more specifically, immediately following a meal is a key
      time to purposely plan on doing something you enjoy.</strong
    >
    Rather than grabbing some snacks after dinner to extend the enjoyable time,
    uproot yourself from the kitchen and grab the book you set aside for
    enjoyment reading, or turn on the next show in a series you are loving.
    Invite yourself to extend the enjoyment without continued food consumption
    being the only option. If you are currently mixing eating time with
    television, reading or your smartphone, separating these behaviors can be
    helpful. Saving the entertainment for after mealtime means you have
    something to look forward to following the meal. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span><strong><br /></strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong
      >My last point on this topic is that if your main course wasn&rsquo;t that
      tasty, it&rsquo;s common to feel like you &ldquo;need&rdquo; dessert or
      chocolate to &ldquo;make up for it&rdquo;.</strong
    >
    If you&rsquo;re eating food you find boring and bland (like boiled green
    beans, plain rice, and plain canned tuna), you can clean you plate and be
    physically satisfied but still be jonesing for something because your need
    for pleasure isn&rsquo;t being met. Spice up your food, don&rsquo;t eat the
    same thing after you got bored of it, and if you made a lousy batch of
    chili, just throw it out rather than force yourself to eat it (and then raid
    the freezer for ice cream).&nbsp;</span

  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Possibility #4: You Want to Avoid Something</span
  >
</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Lastly, you might be prone to grabbing more food to put off something which
    you would potentially be doing after dinner. Say, for example, that at 3 pm
    you think, "after dinner tonight, I'll clean the cat litter box and start my
    ridiculously complicated and stressful taxes."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >When you actually find yourself finishing dinner, sitting comfortably at
    the table with those tasks as the next thing, the odds are considerably in
    favor of stalling by grabbing another slice of bread or a
    cookie.&nbsp;</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Of course the less-fun tasks in life have to get done, so how can we work
    with this reality? One tip I have is to not put stressful tasks immediately
    after a meal. As mentioned in #3 above, planning something pleasant to do,
    even something that takes 5 minutes or less, can help you move on from
    eating. Awareness of what you are doing is also helpful. Once you notice,
    &ldquo;okay I&rsquo;m just stalling on doing the litter box and my
    taxes&rdquo; you can deal with what is really going on and not think,
    <em>my God, why do I still want more chocolate?</em>
    <em>What&rsquo;s wrong with me?</em> You can switch your thinking to the
    options and outcomes:<br /><br />
    <em
      >&ldquo;Do I want to just get it done, so I can feel better sooner and
      cross it off my list, or do I want to keep stalling? If I do want to keep
      stalling, do I want to eat or get out of the kitchen and stall with
      something that is at least noncaloric, like Instagram or
      reading?&rdquo;</em

    >In summary, many people go through periods when they find themselves
    grazing at the end of meals, especially dinner. If this is bothersome to
    you, do some quick checks to see what feels like the reason behind it: </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: 400"
      >Are you physically not quite satisfied? If so, make sure your meals are
      adequately sized to fill you up. Boost the protein or fruits and veggie if
      you aren&rsquo;t sure what to add.</span
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: 400"
      >Do you want something more satisfying as the experience? If so, make your
      meals more tasty and varied, slow down to enjoy them and pay attention to
      the sensory experience. If your day-to-day life feels like it short on
      non-food pleasures, work on including more of them so you don&rsquo;t have
      such a big pent up joy-deficit that you expect food to fill. Because it IS
      just food, and while food can be highly pleasurable and meaningful,
      expecting it to provide all the joy and happiness in our day is asking a
      lot from a plate of sustenance. And that&rsquo;s likely to leave us sorely
      disappointed with just &ldquo;okay&rdquo; meals.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: 400"
      >If you think you might be grazing to avoid something, I encourage you to
      be brave and ask yourself what it is. Is it a task, or is it the feeling
      of boredom? Why do you want to escape it so much? We can learn a lot from
      the things that we fear, so it might be worthwhile to take a peek at why
      you&rsquo;re avoiding the task. And as a reminder, you can always
      procrastinate or distract yourself without food if you want to reduce your
      food intake but aren&rsquo;t ready to take the task on just yet. </span
