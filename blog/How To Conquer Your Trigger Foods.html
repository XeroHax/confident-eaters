  How many of you have foods that you try to steer clear of because you know -
  you just&nbsp;<em>know</em>&nbsp;- that once you start, you can&rsquo;t stop?
  Or perhaps you find yourself intentionally seeking that specific food out
  after a particularly trying day.
</p>
<p>
  A trigger food is a food that you have a difficult time eating a reasonable
  portion of. Eating a little bit usually leads to cleaning off the rest of the
  plate. These are oftentimes highly palatable foods including chips, cookies,
  or chocolate. Usually, individuals have an ongoing, tumultuous relationship
  with said trigger food, and while they may love the taste of it at the moment,
  it usually doesn&rsquo;t end well.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, it&rsquo;s entirely possible to conquer trigger foods. Follow
  this 4-step process below to break free.

<h3>1. Accept That You Are In Control</h3>
<p>
  Forgive the bluntness of this next statement, but it&rsquo;s crucial to
  establish as a fact.&nbsp;<strong
    >Your brain controls the movement of your voluntary muscles, so moving your
    limbs, reaching out to put the food into your mouth, and swallowing it, i<em
      >s your choice</em
    >.</strong
  >&nbsp;No person, or potato chip, or slick marketing can take over your limbs
  and jaws, even if you&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;powerless or
  aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>aware</em>&nbsp;of your thoughts.
</p>
<p>
  The reason that our sole locus of control is so important to hash out is that
  the facts can be very different from the way things feel in our experience. We
  can find a lot of evidence (if we look for it) to build a case that we
  weren&rsquo;t in control because it felt really compelling to do something. If
  we regret something after eating it, our natural cognitive protection
  mechanisms look for a way to not feel as bad, and that can lead to
  justifications to decrease the amount of responsibility we feel. &ldquo;<em
    >But I didn&rsquo;t want to eat the chips, I just couldn&rsquo;t help it</em
  >,&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>My brain shuts off when there is chocolate around</em
  >&rdquo;, and the like.

</p>
<p>
  These insinuations that we weren&rsquo;t in control at the moment do not help
  you change your behavior.<strong
    >&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t effectively work on changing something you&rsquo;re
    still partially in denial of.</strong
  >&nbsp;And if you&rsquo;re reading this article, we can conclude you want to
  know how to change the phenomenon of trigger foods leading to overeating for
  yourself or someone else. So, commit with us right here that eating is a
  choice, and it&rsquo;s a choice we can control.
</p>
<p>
  That&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s easy! That doesn&rsquo;t mean we
  always choose in line with our values and goals -- far from it. It just means
  we accept our place as Head Honcho of Things Consumed, the most empowered
  stance to take. In fact, better to chuck the term &ldquo;trigger food&rdquo;
  altogether. It&rsquo;s a food you have overeaten in the past. It&rsquo;s a
  food you have struggled with moderating, perhaps. But no special status.
  It&rsquo;s one of thousands of foods, made of carbon and oxygen and some
  nitrogen and other chemicals. There&rsquo;s no wizardry; it&rsquo;s just
  ordinary edible stuff, even if you have a bit of a checkered history in how
  you chose to consume it.
</p>
<h3>2. Break the Cycle</h3>
<p>
  Okay, Head Honcho, time to use those executive powers for good. Sounds like
  there&rsquo;s a pattern that you&rsquo;ve picked up on, and it's that your
  hands + a certain food = a situation that hasn&rsquo;t ended well. And
  that&rsquo;s okay, there&rsquo;s exactly zero helpfulness in blaming yourself.
  Let&rsquo;s focus on breaking that pattern. You and your so-called trigger
  food can always reunite down the road, but a little separation, for now, will
  stop the recurring negative experience.
</p>
<p>
  Do you need to get the food out of your kitchen or house? Do you need to chuck
  it, donate it, or just commit to a week of not seeing each other? Take charge
  and do it. Break the cycle of hurt and abuse, then you can re-form a healthy
  relationship.

  /><br />3. Create Safe, Supported Scenarios For Reintroduction
</h3>
<p>
  Think about the negative experiences you had with that specific food in the
  past. What was going on? Where were you? What were you feeling? What time of
  day was it? Were you at home, in your car, at the office or your
  parents&rsquo; house? These factors all contribute to the ease or difficulty
  of eating in line with our values. This means you can engineer an easier
  scenario by thinking about when, and where, and with whom you are least likely
  to overeat a particular food. You don&rsquo;t want to just rendezvous any old
  time and place, you want things to be different this time. Let&rsquo;s use
  some examples:
</p>
<h4>Easier not to overeat ice cream:</h4>
<p>
  I&rsquo;ve bought a portion from the ice cream shop with my friends,
  mid-afternoon on Saturday, and I'm walking around the park eating it. What are
  the odds of going back for seconds? Pretty low. I&rsquo;d have to go back,
  wait on line again, make another purchase&hellip; and it would be odd to do
  with the other people around who are doing the usual buy-and-eat-one pattern.
  If I were trying to establish a healthy moderate relationship with ice cream,
  this would be a good situation to put together. Invite a couple friends and
  you could make this happen. In the end, you&rsquo;re likely to have scored one
  experience of your eating ice cream in the way you want to. High five.
</p>
<p>

    width="291"
    height="291"
  />
</p>
<h4>Now, a situation in which it&rsquo;s much harder:</h4>
<p>
  I get pulled over after a stressful day at work, and a rude cop gives me a
  hefty fine. I get home to see fraudulent charges on my credit card which now I
  have to deal with also. It&rsquo;s cold and raining and my husband is away --
  I feel alone and sad. I have no decent food in the fridge, and there&rsquo;s a
  large container of Oreo ice cream in the freezer.
</p>
<p>
  This is not a helpful scenario in which to decide it&rsquo;s a good time to
  try eating ice cream again. If you have had difficulty moderating consumption
  of a particular food, it&rsquo;s generally not favorable to try and change
  that when you&rsquo;re emotional, stressed, not well slept, in the later hours
  of the day, alone, and have multiple servings in easy reach.
</p>
<p>
  You can control when you choose to have the food again after your break from
  it. Do it when and where you are feeling assured of your success.&nbsp;<em
    >Rig the game so you win.</em
  >
</p>
<h3>4. Gradually Ease Up On Parameters As You Gain Confidence</h3>
<p>
  Once you&rsquo;ve had a chance to eat the food and stop at a place you feel
  good about, it&rsquo;s not over. It will probably take many repetitions to
  bolster your confidence that this food is not, in fact, a volition-sapping
  delicacy.
</p>
<p>
  Keep going. Get those positive experiences in when you are confident it will
  go your way. And over time, you&rsquo;ll notice that confidence growing. Maybe
  after 6 or 7 times having ice cream from the shop with your friends, you feel
  okay to go on your own and buy a single serving and walk around the park
  enjoying it. You might not want to jump right away to having 16 flavors at
  home in bulk supply, so take small steps. You don&rsquo;t HAVE to keep
  anything at home, and many people find their peace with sweets and alcohol
  when they choose to leave them at the store, not bringing it into their homes.
  Consider progressions like this (again, no need to go all the way to the last
  one if your life is easier without it):
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Having the food with company, out of the house</li>
  <li>Having the food on your own, out of the house</li>
  <li>
    Having the food with company at home (buying just enough for no leftovers)
  </li>
  <li>
    Having the food on your own at home (buying just enough for no leftovers)
  </li>
  <li>Having the food on your own at home, even if there are leftovers</li>
</ol>

</h3>
<h3>The Bottom Line:</h3>
<p>
  You are in control of what and how much you eat. If you have particular
  difficulty with a certain food, that&rsquo;s normal and not permanent. You can
  change that.
</p>
<p>
  Start with a commitment to stop repeating what isn&rsquo;t working so you
  don&rsquo;t keep rehearsing the overeating experience with that food. Take a
  break from the food long enough to think of a specific situation in which you
  are darned sure you will not (even cannot) overeat it. When you&rsquo;d like
  to have the food again, have it under your terms. Keep the supports in place
  to rack up many experiences where you eat that food in a way you are happy
  with. Ease off the supports if you feel you don&rsquo;t need them any longer,
  but keep the ones which make your life easiest. Here&rsquo;s a summary graphic
  to help keep it all fresh in your mind:

  /><br />There are no medals for withstanding temptation, so consider it your
  lifetime right to choose where, when, and how you meet particularly tempting
  foods.
