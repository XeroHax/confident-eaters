    >So the saying goes about boxing. But it strikes me that the same thing can
    be said about eating, fitness, or any other endeavour. Like a glazed-over
    boxer staggered by his opponent, making a blunder, facing the unknown or
    simply being under a lot of stress can stagger us, and we forget all about
    the &hellip; "Plan? What plan? Did I have a strategy?" </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >I've learned many lessons in my life about managing stress, and consider
    myself relatively resilient and capable as a baseline, but I would be a fool
    to deny that many times in my life, adversity has made me want to light my
    plan on fire, and find the fastest escape or gratification possible. And
    many times, I did. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >So as that quote about being punched in the face ran across my mind, I
    decided to hunt down some martial artists -- since they have literally been
    punched in face (in the name of sport) and ask how they learned to keep
    their wits about them. These were some of the lessons they had to share: </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong><em>The first time is the hardest. </em></strong
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Everyone said that at first, they were scared or in shock the first time
    their face was on the receiving end of a blow. Some of them instinctively
    ducked back, rather than staying aggressive and coming forward. </span
  ><em
    ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span></em
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><strong><em>It wasn't as terrible as they thought.</em></strong>
  <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >There was always a mental breakthrough of some sort when the competitor
    realized it was not that bad, and they were almost immediately more
    confident in their ability.</span
  >
  <span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><em
    ><strong>They</strong>
    <strong>accepted that it's going to happen</strong></em
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><em>,</em> rather than try and never let it occur again. They developed
    reasonable expectations about how they could train defensively and get
    caught with a punch less of the time, but all the preparations in the world
    couldn't guarantee a complete lack of adversity. </span

    >I can envision a veteran fighter (the person I want to be) taking a hit and
    continuing with their predetermined plan for the bout, where the newer
    athlete (me, when not at my best) might start hastily rethinking what they
    should do and how to get out of there. Dropping the coaches' words,
    forgetting tactics and just swinging in fear or desperation.&nbsp;I can see
    myself keeling over in a "play dead" manner.&nbsp;</span

    >When we were selling our home last year and planning a long distance move,
    the endless complications, delays, renovations, and unpredictability got to
    me. I didn&rsquo;t want to carefully (wisely) consider anything, I wanted to
    make decisions and get outta there and into the mountains! I felt my
    patience decreasing with the whole process. And this was no hardship out of
    the ordinary, predictable strife of moving - just minor renovations which
    are unwaveringly </span
  ><em><span style="font-weight: 400">never </span></em
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >completed on time, are they? But I was not handling this gracefully, or
    according to a logical game plan. I recall desperation, wanting the </span
  ><em><span style="font-weight: 400">fastest way out</span></em
  ><span style="font-weight: 400">
    at some point, which financially would have been a terrible idea and luckily
    I didn&rsquo;t slash the price to get the home sale over with. But had there
    not been a level-headed husband in the picture? I might have. It's easy to
    be me-focused, now-focused, numb-my-pain-focused. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >I know, because one of our previous moves went differently. The calendar
    year of 2012 in my life exceeded my personal tolerance for drama and
    upheaval. In less than 6 months, I had gotten a divorce, fallen in love with
    Roland (okay, maybe in the opposite order), sold my home and car, relocated
    from Colorado to Canada (during which our belongings were lost for 4 weeks
    by the transport company), started a business from scratch, all while
    navigating serious undiagnosed back pain and discovering what panic attacks
    felt like. I was in shreds, physically and emotionally. As we looked for an
    apartment to rent in Victoria, BC, I needed the search to be over like a
    seasick traveler desperately begs the horizon to show the shoreline. Now. I
    needed a home, some stability, and a place to lie down. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >And I said I wanted the first place I saw. It was cheap, I&rsquo;ll give it
    that. But it had bars on the windows, the sketchiest caretaker ever,
    splotches of green paint spilled on the hallway&rsquo;s maroon and gold
    dirty carpet. There was a hole in the wall just above the button you pressed
    to summon the death trap elevator. And another larger hole just outside the
    door to our unit. I said it &ldquo;worked for me&rdquo;, before I even
    realized the whole place smelled like piss and smoke. There is no doubt
    Roland knew we could do better. It would just take another bit of looking,
    maybe seeing a few more places for comparison. I suspect some complex
    emotional state of his own, blending fatigue, pity, and love led him to
    concede.&nbsp;</span

    >I know I am not the only one who has experienced acting in desperation when
    times are tough. Stuff not going the way we planned or expected can feel
    like a punch in the face. The easy, less responsible road suddenly becomes
    appealing when things feel like they're going wrong. A normal gut instinct
    is to abandon plans to carry out multi step projects diligently and
    patiently, and impulsively scramble for a quick action, even if it&rsquo;s a
    complete dumpster fire of an idea. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >This can absolutely happen in the form of bailing on food and exercise
    plans. Jumping from diet to diet, exercise program to exercise program, as
    soon as something doesn't feel right or smooth. As soon as we find something
    harder than we thought, when we are worn down and out of endurance, our eyes
    scan the periphery to find the exit we want. The closest one will do. </span

    >Imagine yourself planning to practice your Lean Habits while away on a work
    trip. But the day you depart, you are later than you anticipated getting to
    the airport, then security clearance takes an ice age to get through, and
    you reach the gate right when you need to board. There goes your plan to
    scope out a decent meal from the terminal.&nbsp; You were planning to find a
    turkey sandwich, or salad with chicken, at worst an apple and protein bar,
    but here you are with Pringles, M&amp;Ms and a paper cup of terrible coffee
    for &ldquo;lunch&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span

    >What are the odds you can return to your planned healthy eating strategy
    for the rest of the business trip? Good, fair, poor? Many people would
    abandon their plan and continue eating poorly for hours or days after. Other
    people would abandon their plan in a patch-things-up attempt and try to
    compensate by skipping dinner, putting in an hour on the treadmill in some
    dreadful hotel fitness room that smells like sweat, then end up sleeping
    terribly and overdoing it on pancakes the following morning at breakfast,
    causing more and more distress.</span

    >I want you to be able to push past rocky moments like the above example and
    just keep going. I want you to be able to have hard days or weeks and fight
    the urge to light something on fire and run for the hills. I want you to get
    actual results rather than falling for the illusory promises of quick fixes,
    or starting over again and again and again. So next time, before you call it
    quits because you made a mistake or life got in your way, remember what the
    boxers and fighters can teach us: </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong>1. The first time you get punched is the hardest.</strong> It's
    normal to be scared and hurt. Your first move, heartbreak, child, thesis
    defense, or overwhelming job is also going to be scary, and possibly
    painful. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong
      >2. Remember that scared and hurt does not mean you&rsquo;ve lost.</strong
    >
    Stay calm. Life's punches often come as difficult emotions, inconvenience,
    financial loss or challenging conversations, but rarely are they truly
    destroying catastrophes. You probably aren't knocked out. You can keep going
    without quitting. </span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"><br /></span
  ><span style="font-weight: 400"
    ><strong>3. Expect it.</strong> Tough times befall every one of us, and
    developing skills and taking preventative action can only help us reduce the
    odds of some adversity. Pain will come your way in life. So do what you can,
    but plan on encountering tough times in the future, and see yourself coming
    through them. Even the champions take hits. Because joy and easier times
    will also come your way, and when you can look back and see yourself
    choosing to stick it out instead of quitting, you&rsquo;ll be immeasurably
    proud.</span
