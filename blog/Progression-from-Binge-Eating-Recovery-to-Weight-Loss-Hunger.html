  To keep binges at bay, it's best -- at least initially -- to eat frequently
  enough and avoid getting hungry. But as you probably guessed, that can prevent
  weight loss if you kept it up forever. What's a person to do if they want to
  eventually be able to lose weight? In this episode, we walk you though the
  steps we use with our clients to move away from binge eating and towards a
  healthy lifetime weight, getting to know and relate to hunger in new,
  positive, healthy ways.

<h2>
  &ldquo;Deer in the headlights&rdquo;, would be the best way to describe the
  look on Bethany&rsquo;s face.
</h2>
<p>
  She was speechless, motionless. I was coaching her over a video chat and had
  just brought up the idea that the next skill we might explore was feeling
  hunger. From the look on her face, you&rsquo;d have thought I said
  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s throw steaks in the water and swim with sharks!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  I can&rsquo;t blame Bethany for being hesitant. Lots of people over the years
  had told her that hunger was bad. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let yourself get too
  hungry.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go into starvation mode.&rdquo;
  &ldquo;Gotta boost that metabolism!&rdquo; Trainers, Weight Watchers leaders,
  even magazine headlines were in on the consistent message that this sensation
  is bad, or at least, that it&rsquo;s avoidable. She saw the ads: &ldquo;Lose
  40 pounds and never feel hungry&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
  One of the things I admire about Bethany and people like her, is that despite
  her hesitation, she was ready to hear more. &ldquo;Ok, tell me about
  it,&rdquo; she said. She knew I must have a reason for bringing it up, and she
  trusted that I wasn&rsquo;t out to make her life a living hell. After all, so
  far, nothing we had done had meant major suffering, and she had come a long
  way with stopping binge eating.
</p>
<p>
  The coaching process is a journey, and often part of the journey is a
  progression through getting to know, make peace with, and even make friends
  with, our body&rsquo;s sensation of hunger. Since it doesn&rsquo;t happen
  overnight or in one massive epiphany, I&rsquo;ll be breaking it all down in
  this episode.
</p>
<p>
  Raise your hand if you really don&rsquo;t like hunger. If hunger were a
  person, would you rather <strong>not</strong> spend time together? If so,
  that&rsquo;s okay. We understand, and it makes sense if you&rsquo;ve had
  unpleasant experiences before. Dieting may have meant you guys spent too much
  time together in the past. Or you may have heard messages like Bethany that
  hunger was up to no good.
</p>
<h3>
  The first step in this progression is to clean the slate mentally, letting go
  of the beliefs and associations you have about hunger from your past.
</h3>
<p>
  In case it helps, I&rsquo;m going to give you some straight facts right now on
  hunger:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Hunger is a sensation you feel in your abdomen. It&rsquo;s different from
    wanting food or desiring to eat - so when you think about experiencing
    hunger, think of your belly. It will feel like an empty-hollow sensation.
  </li>
  <li>Hunger doesn&rsquo;t mean anything bad is going to happen to you.</li>
  <li>
    Hunger isn&rsquo;t dangerous. Your body is equipped to survive for long
    periods of time without food.
  </li>
  <li>
    Feeling hunger for a little while before eating is an accurate way to know
    how your overall energy balance is - without having to count anything! If
    you never feel hungry before eating, you are probably taking in more energy
    than your body is burning.
  </li>
  <li>
    Feeling hungry for a little while will also not hijack your rational mind.
    Feeling hungry for 3 or 4 minutes will not instantly make you murder people
    or steal doughnuts. Excessive hunger can cause emotional distress - but
    we&rsquo;re not going there! We&rsquo;re talking small, safe visits with
    hunger.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>The second step is to practice feeling for hunger.</h3>
<p>
  Again, it&rsquo;s super important here to focus on your abdomen, not what
  might be going on in your head. To practice feeling hunger, you can wait a
  while between meals and sooner or later it will show up! You may also find
  that if you have a meal or snack time in you daily routine that you
  don&rsquo;t think you really need, you can skip it and feel some hunger before
  your next meal. If you&rsquo;re anxious about hunger showing up, you might
  want to choose a time when you are relaxed and at home, and have food prepared
  so you don&rsquo;t have to spend lots of time with hunger, you can just notice
  it, shake it&rsquo;s hand, and then eat in a few minutes.
</p>
<p>
  Most people want to spend plenty of time in this phase, just feeling hunger
  once a day for a few minutes. With each repeat, we can get more assured that
  we won&rsquo;t actually die if we get hungry, and it gets less and less scary.
  Feel free to spend as much time in this step as you want!!! You cannot go too
  slowly.
</p>
<h3>
  The third step in the progression is to practice feeling for it a bit longer,
  and more often.
</h3>
<p>
  Once you are feeling hunger once a day for a few minutes, you can gradually
  practice feeling it for 10 or 15 minutes, working your way up to 30 minutes.
  You also will find it&rsquo;s manageable to practice it more than once a day,
  working your way towards feeling hunger for most if not all times you eat.
</p>
<p>
  You&rsquo;ll likely have to do some shifting of your meal size and timing to
  settle into a pattern of feeling hungry for about 30 minutes before each time
  you eat. You might move from eating 5-6 times a day to eating slightly fewer
  times with a bit more space between. Or, you might eat the same number of
  times per day, but dial back the portions slightly. You might find you can
  drop one of the side dishes you have with your lunch, or have a few bites less
  of each thing. <br />I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again, go
  slowly and make little changes. If you do end up feeling stomach-hunger WAY
  before a planned meal, don&rsquo;t force yourself to sit through hours of
  hunger - just have something to eat and take note that whatever you ate
  didn&rsquo;t keep hunger at bay for quite long enough.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >Don&rsquo;t overshoot on this step, because more hunger is not
    better</strong
  >. 30 to 60 minutes is the window of hunger we recommend, and that&rsquo;s
  enough to see weight loss. Don&rsquo;t push yourself to feel hunger for more
  than an hour at a time on a regular basis, and we also don&rsquo;t recommend
  eating fewer than 3 times per day.
</p>
<h3>
  And the most advanced step: develop some appreciation for your hunger signals
  and notice the benefits!
</h3>
<p>
  It may sound crazy to someone on the outside, but when you&rsquo;ve actually
  gone through the sequence you might discover the strangest thing happens. You
  sort of begin to appreciate your hunger signals. Not because being hungry is
  fun - I haven&rsquo;t heard anyone say that! But because you recognize how
  this simple system works so well to keep you on track, not eating too much,
  not eating too little! You don&rsquo;t have to count calories or grams or
  points, you just try to keep hitting that 30-60 minute window before you eat.
</p>
<p>
  When hunger does show up, you begin to feel happy and more confident, because
  you know &ldquo;hey I&rsquo;m doing this right! I&rsquo;m on track!&rdquo; You
  can stop worrying if you ate too much because hunger shows up, pats you on the
  back and says, &ldquo;hey, it's me again, I&rsquo;ve run through the fuel we
  had a while ago, how about we eat in half an hour or so?&rdquo;
  <br /><br />It&rsquo;s simple, it works, and it can cut through all the mental
  stress you ever had about following a diet. It can also help set you free of
  compulsively weighing yourself to know if you are &ldquo;on track&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;doing well&rdquo;. If you are feeling hungry before each meal, you are
  on track and doing well.
</p>
<p>
  In this stage you&rsquo;ll also notice some real tangible benefits aside from
  the mental ones. Your clothes and weight will probably start to change once
  you consistently allow yourself to feel hungry before eating for a couple
  weeks. Food tastes better too, and clients often comment about how much more
  they are enjoying their meals once they wait to be hungry first.
</p>
<p>
  Noticing the positive benefits of this practice is a crucial step to doing it
  long term. If you tell yourself that hunger is horrible and awful and
  uncomfortable and you are only doing this so you can lose weight&hellip;
  you&rsquo;ll stop doing it. And then you&rsquo;ll go back to whatever weight
  your old eating habits supported. But if you purposely notice the upsides, how
  it&rsquo;s not that bad, how it has a lot of rewards, you can see yourself
  being someone who waits until they are hungry to eat from now on.
</p>
<p>
  To summarize this progression:<br /><br />1. The first step is to clean the
  slate mentally, letting go of the beliefs and associations you have about
  hunger from your past.
</p>
<p>
  2. The second step is to practice feeling for hunger, just a few minutes, once
  a day.
</p>
<p>
  3. The third step in the progression is to practice feeling for it a bit
  longer, and more often. Working up to 30 minutes before most or all of the
  times you eat. <br /><br />4. And the most advanced step: develop some
  appreciation for your hunger signals and notice the benefits.
