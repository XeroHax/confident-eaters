  Everyone know what to expect from the actual holiday, but that first day back
  at work, WHAM. It's often something that blindsides people with how
  demoralizing and tough it can be.&nbsp;

  /><br />The difficulty of the post-holiday return to work is often a complete
  surprise to people. My clients often&nbsp;worry&nbsp;whether it&nbsp;is a
  potential indicator of a greater, more serious, problem.&nbsp;There can
  be&nbsp;a lot of stress, frustration, and regretted food behaviors on account
  of these feelings.
</p>
<p>
  It has led me to think more about how I can help people predict these
  not-so-obvious emotional and nutritional challenges. How can these peak
  frustration days be... more manageable?

  The first day at a new job many of us expect to be tough, but I see that
  difficulty and overwhelm persist for about two weeks. Similarly, planning for
  how a person wants to eat and drink while&nbsp;<em>on&nbsp;</em>vacation is
  common, but frequently the returning home can be a rocky re-entry. And if you
  ever wondered if you were the only one feeling a little crappy every single
  Sunday, you aren't! Lots of people have a wave of anxiety or blues as the
  weekend draws to a close. Having people come stay at your house is definitely
  stressful, no matter how much you love them and have looked forward to their
  visit.
</p>
<p>
  When you have events or transitions like this on the horizon, you might plan
  ahead to clean the house or buy a new outfit, and I'd like to suggest that you
  also anticipate nutrition challenges that will be involved. Anticipating
  unpleasant feelings will not necessarily make them any less intense, but it
  will help you not be taken by surprise so you can accept and cope with them
  more purposefully. And you might be able to show yourself a little more
  compassion and kindness in the moment.
</p>
<h3>The Bigger Issue: Completely Unpredictable Turbulence</h3>
<p>
  If you've been alive more than a few days, you've witnessed how some difficult
  things are just going to pop up by surprise. Someone makes a rude or hurtful
  judgment about you, the roof starts leaking, your tooth starts stabbing you
  with pain... and there was no predicting or preparing possible. I would say
  the vast majority of emotional stressors that I talk with my clients about are
  of this type. The things that cause the most nutritional trouble are
  surprises.
</p>
<p>
  So what can you do? I call it expectations management, and&nbsp;<strong
    >it entails approaching the world with a mindset that is expecting and
    accepting of a wide spectrum of outcomes, some of which will be wonderful,
    and some of which will suck.</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps it is a human default to expect others to behave in the same way we
  would, and for the world to operate in an efficient and fair way. I value
  efficiency and fairness, and I would&nbsp;<em>like&nbsp;</em>other people to
  know how to navigate a four-way stop. But, I have a choice. I can expect that
  not everyone will behave like me, or get frustrated because I expected them to
  and they didn't.
</p>
<p>
  Day to day, having expectations that everything is going to go smoothly will
  mean we're disappointed a fair chunk of the time. I am mildly worried when I
  ask my clients what challenges could pop up in the coming week and they say
  "nothing." I love the confidence, I admire the preparation that they have done
  to help set themselves up for success, and yet I'm fearful their computer will
  crash, their assistant will double-book them, and they will be blindsided.
</p>
<p>
  So my suggestion if you find yourself frustrated often is to try to broaden
  your expectations and hold them loosely. Expect all types of people to cross
  your path. Some people are bound to be rude, others helpful and loving. It's
  not a reflection on you.
</p>
<h3>Frustrated With Yourself?</h3>
<p>
  You will not be the same day to day, so it's unfair to hold yourself to a
  standard of equal performance 365 days a year. You'll have a range of ability,
  output, and success. Be human, it's ok. You can control your actions, words,
  and choices, but you cannot control the impact they have on the world.
  Therefore, it's not a favorable setup to have a specific impact in mind. Focus
  on fair, flexible expectations for your effort you put in, and the choices
  you&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;control.
</p>
<p>
  By holding your expectations lightly, I'm referring to how we react to the
  inevitable gaps between what actually&nbsp;<em>is,</em>&nbsp;and what we
  wanted or&nbsp;<em>expected.</em>&nbsp;<strong
    >By holding our predictions of the future with a light grip, we remember
    that things may turn out be different, but still be fine.</strong
  >&nbsp;We become more resilient and adaptable, and we can thrive in an
  ever-changing and unpredictable life. If you do feel yourself getting
  frustrated time to time, take a pause, and ask yourself what expectation you
  had that's not being met. Could you broaden it a bit, make it more realistic,
  or hold it more loosely?
