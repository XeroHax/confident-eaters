    >I&rsquo;m a great example of someone whose default is to try and buy the

    >However,
    <strong>always trying for a minimal calorie intake can backfire</strong>,
    much like buying the cheapest car or blender can leave you spending more
    money in the long run. I&rsquo;ve seen a few clients get derailed by this
    sort of thinking in recent weeks, so I&rsquo;d like to prevent it from
    happening to you. Real skill in eating for lifelong leanness is knowing when
    to eat a little more, choose the higher calorie thing, or choose to eat
    instead of passing on food. </span

    You might be able to skip the unplanned eating by giving yourself more of
    the planned, healthy food at meals. You might be able to keep you total
    intake lower if you eat the &ldquo;real dessert&rdquo;. Maybe you need a
    &frac12; cup instead of a â…“ cup of oatmeal with breakfast to kick the snack
    habit. Maybe you should eat some carbohydrates on the long hike so you
    don&rsquo;t eat an entire pizza after. Maybe a few bites extra of salmon and
    green beans at dinner would give you better sleep and prevent the 2 am
    peanut butter sandwiches. </span
