      <h1>Georgie's Mentorship</h1>
      <p>
        The problem with becoming a nutrition coach is that you have a zillion
        choices for where to learn about nutrition, and practically no resources
        to learn about coaching.
      </p>

      <p>
        We've all heard people say "I know what I want to do, I'm just not doing
        it" when it comes to their eating and workout routines. For nutrition
        and fitness professionals, this same refrain often is accurate for our
        client interactions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          We know we want to make every person feel motivated, inspired, and
          confident.
        </li>
        <li>We know we want all of our clients to get results.</li>
        <li>We want to see them achieve what we know they are capable of.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        But we just aren't doing it. Only some of our clients seem to be
        motivated. Only some folks are getting results while many people seem to
        be spinning their wheels. Some people don't seem convinced, no matter
        how many different ways we try to convey the information. And we see so
        much untapped potential in the people we work with.
      </p>

      <h3>You don't need to try harder. You need a mentor.</h3>

      <p>
        Effective coaching isn't a black box of mystery. It's a set of skills -
        such as how you listen, how you ask questions, the challenges you select
        for your clients and how you support them along the way. If no one has
        shown you exactly how to do these optimally, how would you ever know?
      </p>

      <p>
        Our mentorship develops your skills so that you can coach more
        effectively and with greater confidence (yes, even that difficult client
        you just thought of). And like most activities, as you build your
        skills, coaching becomes increasingly enjoyable.
      </p>

      <h3>The nuts and bolts:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You'll meet with your mentor weekly, and work through a curriculum
          that takes 16-18 weeks to complete on average.
        </li>

        <li>
          You'll have a systematic way to assess, follow-up, and support
          clients.
        </li>
        <li>
          You'll practice and improve your listening, empathy, client rapport,
          ability to handle tough discussions, motivational skills, and more.
        </li>

        <li>
          You'll learn creative new techniques, exercises and homework to
          provide clients.
        </li>
        <li>
          You'll have an expert nutrition counsellor to answer all your
          questions about coaching, your clients, or yourself.
        </li>
      </ul>
