      <h1>Not Dieting Means Not Rebounding</h1>
      <p>
        Beating yourself up doesn't work. Swearing off chocolate doesn't work.
        Locking the cabinets or staying at a weight loss resort where you have
        zero access to extra foods actually can work... for a week. But then the
        rebound kicks in because these things make us profoundly uncomfortable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rebounding after a weight loss diet is the norm, because diets make us
        uncomfortable. They take away our freedom, deny us foods we really love,
        and can cause physical annoyances like always-there hunger and low
        energy. Who would choose to stay uncomfortable for the remainder of
        their life?
      </p>

      <p>
        Losing weight and maintaining that change permanently is only possible
        when the changes are comfortable and rewarding enough that we want to do
        them forever. So, we've made those changes comfortable and rewarding.
      </p>

      <p>What is this magic you speak of?</p>

      <p>
        It works like this: Complicated directions and confusing methods are
        painful. We utilize simplicity and clarity, and teach how to do things,
        where others just tell you to do them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Denying yourself is distressing. We show you how to maximize enjoyment
        and satisfaction so choosing differently doesn't mean opting for
        something lousier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going it alone is tedious. Having an expert coach as your companion
        transforms a long, boring chore into an exploration that feels
        enriching.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doing things just to lose weight gets old. Fast. When your choices not
        only reshape your body but reward you with self-respect, freedom of
        choice and connection with your body, you aren't going to go back.
      </p>

      <p>When the methods feel good, no rebound is in sight.</p>
      <h2>Gain some time you lost dieting by getting a fast-forward</h2>
      <p>
        Going it alone can work, but how often have we all done the usual
        pattern? We pick our goal and it's a good one, we believe in it. We pick
        a plan. It is also pretty amazing, we think. We get to work on it. First
        few days are great, but since it's work, it can be tough. Then, a week
        in and we find we took a day off. We earned it, no biggie. Another week
        later and we might recognize that we just aren't doing what we planned.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's were a coach can make all the difference. To keep you on track
        and, maybe even more importantly, to really see you.
      </p>
      <p>It can be incredibly difficult to be objective about ourselves.</p>
      <p>
        The solution? Hire one of our coaches to keep you on track and give you
        their years of experience and expertise
