      <h1>Breaking Up With Binge Eating</h1>
      <p>
        "It would be easy to lose weight if I could just stop sneaking off to
        gorge on junk food alone in my car. The harder I try, the worse it gets.
        It's like an alien takes over my body." ~ Claire
      </p>
      <h2>
        Six Months From Now You Could Be Living Life Confident That You've
        Kicked Binge Eating For Good So That You Can Lose Weight, (Or Maintain
        Because It's 100% Your Choice)
      </h2>
      <p>
        Amanda couldn't go. Her stomach hurt and it felt like her skin was about
        to burst, but that wasn't the most painful part.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the third time she had to cancel plans with her old roommate
        from college because she binged an hour before.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been ten years since she lived with Jennifer, and when they agree
        to meet her nerves get to her, and it triggers a binge.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were the best of friends in college and very much alike. Both
        graduated with honors from their master's programs. Both were, and are,
        intelligent. Each was popular, kind, funny, and hard-working.
      </p>
      <p>They shared something else, too, even though they didn't know it.</p>
      <p>
        Both started secretly binge eating when they lived together. It's more
        common than people think for roommates to start binge eating in college.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today they still have a lot in common. Both are very successful in their
        careers. Both have traveled a lot, and both have rich lives.
      </p>
      <p>One important difference, though.</p>
      <p>
        Jennifer hasn't binged in years. She's healthy, lean, fit, energetic,
        and lives her life her way. Free from thinking about food all day.
      </p>

      <h2>What Made The Difference?</h2>

      <p>We can tell you that it isn't the usual suspects.</p>
      <p>
        It isn't that Amanda didn't want it as much. It wasn't that she didn't
        try as hard. It sure wasn't determination, either.
      </p>
      <p>
        We tend to blame ourselves. We feel shame. There must be something wrong
        with us.
      </p>
      <p>None of that is true.</p>
      <p>
        Jennifer was lucky enough to see what others didn't. She identified the
        path from binge eating, to not binge eating, and then all the way to eating
        like a "normal person."
      </p>
      <p>That last part is critical. The job isn't done at not bingeing.</p>

      <p>
        The "Breaking Up With Binge Eating Program" is the only program designed to
        take you the whole way to living confidently in your body and eating
        without worry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other programs stop at not binge eating, and eventually that leads us
        right back to where we started.
      </p>

      <h2>What Are Our Options?</h2>

      <p>1. Treatment centers.</p>

      <p>
        Some treatment centers do a great job of helping us stop binge eating
        while we're there. While in a controlled environment, we can make good
        progress, but we know what happens when we return to the real world.
        It's not good.
      </p>

      <p>
        These treatment centers cost thousands of dollars, and not only do they
        not take us all the way past not-bingeing, but they don't prepare us for
        when we return to the old life.
      </p>

      <p>2. Intuitive Eating / Health at Every Size Programs.</p>

      <p>
        We love intuitive eating and body acceptance. Both of those go a very
        long way to ending binge eating. We use these principles, too.
      </p>

      <p>
        As far as these programs go, they don't go all the way. For one thing,
        what about weight loss? Some folks are encouraged to avoid losing
        weight, but most of us know that excess weight is still a health risk,
        and we need to eat in a way that supports our whole health, not just our
        mental health.
      </p>

      <p>
        Plus, even if we accept ourselves and learn to eat intuitively, that
        doesn't mean we are free of emotional eating, which is the precursor to
        binge eating. And what if your intuition wants chocolate cake all the
        time?
      </p>

      <p>3. Bright Line Eating (and other diets).</p>

      <p>
        A prevalent practice is to go on a stringent diet, using rules to
        eliminate "bad behavior." This can work for some of us, but most of us
        end up making the restrict/binge cycle worse.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rules-based eating might stop the binge for a time, but it worsens the
        triggers when they show up again, and they always show up again.
      </p>

      <p>4. 12-Step Programs.</p>

      <p>
        Programs like Overeaters Anonymous have also worked for some of us.
        However, one thing that doesn't work for many of us is that the 12-Step
        Programs set us up in a way that is a double-edged sword.
      </p>

      <p>
        They teach us that we are diseased and powerless. For some of us, great,
        that works. We are like the addict who cannot go to restaurants and work
        functions without significant pain, for that is where we are
        "powerless." That's where the triggers are.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the rest of us, we need to beat the binge, not accept that it beats
        us.
      </p>

      <p>5. Books like "Brain Over Binge."</p>

      <p>
        It is a great read and a powerful inspiration. There are a lot of useful tools in that book and especially its follow-up workbook. For some of us, this does
        the trick. We commit to quitting and use the tools to deal with binge
        urges.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, to be free, we need to go further. We have to get to "normal."
      </p>

      <h2>Introducing The "Breaking Up With Binge Eating" Program</h2>

      <p>
        The way to progress from dealing with binging all the way to not having
        a binge issue at all, so that we can lose weight if we want or not.
      </p>

      <p>
        So that we can eat intuitively and stay lean and healthy without worry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Breaking Up With Binge Eating is a coaching program, not just a course.
        We have coaches that are there for you every step of the way. We don't
        hide them behind funky policies and recorded coaching calls.
      </p>

      <p>
        Georgie and Maryclaire are right there with you in the group, chatting,
        answering questions, and helping you when you need it. If you are lucky
        enough to work one-on-one with Georgie or Maryclaire, you have a real
        partner in this.
      </p>

      <p>
        We do have a curriculum, though! Each week you get a lesson and a
        practice that we'll be there to help you with.
      </p>

      <h2>Our next group starts Wednesday, May 3, 2023.</h2>

      <p>Including, but not limited to, the following:</p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 1:</b> Set up your motivation right so that you start strong,
        and when motivation inevitably declines, you can reactive it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 2:</b> Set your eating plan to significantly reduce the
        physiological likelihood of bingeing. Less urge = more success.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 3:</b> Use our 3D Binge Stopper Process to stop binges before
        they even start.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 4:</b> Future-proof your life so you can handle anything that
        comes your way, like that work function next week where Frank brings
        five pizzas to a meeting with three people.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 5:</b> Handle trigger foods like a boss because we can't avoid
        them forever, and our self-esteem takes a hit every time we break a
        promise never to eat a thing again, and we eat it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 6:</b> Identify and eliminate the restriction rules that seem
        like good ideas but instead reduce our willpower and exacerbate the
        restrict/binge cycle.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 7:</b> Greatly reduce the stress triggers by learning to make
        peace with your body.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 8:</b> Identify and defuse the emotional factors that cause a
        binge.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 9:</b> Eat the types of foods that support the physiology that
        helps eliminate the binge urges and generally make us feel great.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 10:</b> Discover how not to let emotional triggers affect you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 11:</b> Discover the rewards and treats that will replace the
        binges so that if they are triggered, you can satisfy them with
        something else.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 12:</b> Make being kind to yourself a habit so that you stop
        judging yourself and talking yourself into unconsciously thinking that
        you deserve the binge.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 13:</b> Make the switch from "hunger is an emergency," into a
        healthy positive so that it works for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 14:</b> Discover how to get satisfied without a binge so you can
        transition towards weight loss.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 15:</b> Eliminate the sabotaging thoughts that are most likely
        to cause a relapse.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 16:</b> Reintroduce trigger foods in a way that they don't
        trigger binges anymore.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 17:</b> Learn the meal planning strategy that prevents binges
        and promotes a healthy weight.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 18:</b> Get a dose of the right movement that supports both a
        healthy weight and being binge-free.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Week 19-26:</b> All about fine-tuning and individualizing your
        long-term strategy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus:</b> You get six phone calls to talk to a coach when you need
        them most. You are in control of when you use them. You'll get a
        one-on-one with a coach without paying for one-on-one prices. And we
        understand the importance of getting them quickly when you want them.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you end up feeling really low, and you need that lifeline, you
        don't want to wait long. We'll have you feeling better and doing better
        before other coaches fit you into their calendars.
      </p>

      <h3>A note about the price:</h3>

      <p>
        Regular programs like this are more than $360/month. We'd like to keep
        it as low as we can, but you should know that this is a purposefully low
        price. It's also month-to-month, as in, there's no contract.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's our twelfth running of the program, and we made it much better than
        before. We're charging $149/month, this might be where we land on price,
        but just know that we're still figuring the price out.
      </p>

      <p>
        The man-hours are extensive, but we'll land on the best price that we
        can as we grow.
