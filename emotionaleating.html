      <h1>Emotional Eating Has Done It's Job, Time To Let It Go</h1>
      <p>
        It just keeps coming. Work is overwhelming. Family conflict has you
        worried. And even when there's something to celebrate, and you finally
        have some respite to relax, the overeating keeps happening. If life's
        river of emotions could just pause for a bit, it would feel possible to
        eat consistently and reach your goals.
      </p>

      <p>
        The emotions are going keep flowing, but the current doesn't have to
        keep washing you over to the pantry every time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Emotional eating is a catch-all term for hundreds of different
        behaviors: sad eating, celebratory eating, disappointment eating, anger
        eating, frustration eating...it would be a long list.
      </p>

      <p>
        This catch-all label actually encompasses the problem perfectly: using
        food as a catch-all for managing feelings. The way out is conceptually
        obvious, but blindingly difficult to figure out on your own. Stopping
        emotional eating meals learning what to do with your emotions instead.
      </p>

      <p>Easier said than done! Here's how we do it.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We recognize that ANY catch-all response for the wide array of human
          emotions is problematic.
        </li>
        <li>
          We get specific. Which emotions are resulting in you turning to food?
          For some people it's every strong feeling, for other people only
          specific trigger feelings exist.
        </li>
        <li>
          We teach you step by step to recognize different emotions, amass, and
          develop a toolkit of effective, healthy responses for each one.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Become a confident, sensible eater</h2>
      <p>
        Going it alone can work, but how often have we all done the usual
        pattern? We pick our goal and it's a good one, we believe in it. We pick
        a plan. It is also pretty amazing, we think. We get to work on it. First
        few days are great, but since it's work, it can be tough. Then, a week
        in and we find we took a day off. We earned it, no biggie. Another week
        later and we might recognize that we just aren't doing what we planned.
      </p>
